1 Improving Coverage and Reducing Overgeneration
   
   13: The correct translation for 13 is:
   
   Muiny e   lono ala      ani.
   Dog   loc park 3pl.real eat
   Dogs in the park eat.

   Initially we were getting that result as well as one where the PP appeared
      before the thing it modifies:
   
   *E  lono muiny ala      ani
   Loc park dog   3pl.real eat
   Dogs in the park eat.
   
   To fix this, we changed the head of the non-head daughter of
      my-adj-head-phrase rule from +jrp to +jr. The final tdl look like this:

   my-adj-head-phrase := adj-head-int-phrase &
     [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +nvr,
       NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD +jr,

   18: To get non pronominal posession working, we used the customization site
      to add a posessive strategy in which the possessum appears first, it
      behaves like a modifier, and the possessor is marked by a separate word.
      'e'. Here is the final corresponding tdl in lexicon.tdl and ttv.tdl.

   20, 21, 22: which_q_rel > wh_q_rel
      To fix these sentences, we simply changed the spelling of the PRED value
         of wh words form which_q_rel to wh_q_rel.

   25: Manuai i matir alan muiny i matir.
      Previously, sentence 25 generated four results, each with "alan" at the
         beginning of the sentence:
         
         *Alan   manuai i        matir muiny i        matir.
         Because cat    3sg.real sleep dog   3sg.real sleep
         Because the cat sleeps, the dog sleeps.
      
      To get alan to appear after the subordinate clause, we changed this rule:
         realis-clause-init-prehead-s-attach-subord-lex-item := subord-with-verbal-comp-lex &
            ...
            INIT +
      
      to this:
         realis-clause-final-prehead-s-attach-subord-lex-item := subord-with-verbal-comp-lex &
            ...
            INIT -
      
      After this, two of the incorrect results had the VP "manuai matir alan", in
         which the <complement> of "alan" is a non-finite VP. To fix this, we
         specifyied that the MOD value of "alan" must be FORM finite.
   
      The final tdl for "alan" is:
      
      realis-clause-final-prehead-s-attach-subord-lex-item := subord-with-verbal-comp-lex & non-local-none-lex-item &
        [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.MOOD #feat,

                                                     CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.MOOD #feat & realis ] ] >,
                               POSTHEAD -,
                               HEAD [ MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL.SUBJ < > ,
                                                          HEAD.FORM finite ] ] >,
                                      INIT - ] ] ] ].

2 Transfer Rules
   6: "think" and "know" > "va" (think/know)
      In Titan, "va" means both think and say. "Know" does not show up in our
         corpus, so to translate sentence 6, we are saying that know means
         think and know. The PRED value for "va" is _think-or-know_v_rel. We
         made and instantiated the following transfer rules:

      think-titan-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
      [ INPUT.RELS < [ PRED "_think_v_rel",
                        ARG0 #event,
                        ARG1 #subj ] >,
        OUTPUT.RELS < [ PRED "_think-or-know_v_rel",
                          ARG0 #event,
                          ARG1 #subj ] > ].
      
      know-titan-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
      [ INPUT.RELS < [ PRED "_know_v_rel",
                        ARG0 #event,
                        ARG1 #subj ] >,
        OUTPUT.RELS < [ PRED "_think-or-know_v_rel",
                          ARG0 #event,
                          ARG1 #subj] > ].
   
   For additional cleanup related to sentence 6, we made the agreement clitics
      obligatory for first and second singular with the following tdl:

   aux15-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
     [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.MOOD realis,
                      CAT.VAL [ SUBJ.FIRST [ OPT -,
                                             LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 2nd,
                                                                         NUM sg ] ],
                                COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ] ],
       INFLECTED.VERB-PC8-FLAG - ].

   aux25-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred & verb-pc12-rule-dtr &
     [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.MOOD realis,
                      CAT.VAL [ SUBJ.FIRST [ OPT -,
                                             LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 1st,
                                                                         NUM sg ] ],
                                COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ] ],
       INFLECTED.VERB-PC12-FLAG - ].

   We also wanted to disallow pronouns appearing
      with verbal clitics when they are the same, such as:
   
   *Awa awa      kip.
   2pl  2pl.real lie.
   You lie.
   
   To do this we specified PRON - on the first element of the subject list of
      aux37, which correspond to 'awa'.

   15: "hunger eats the dogs" > "the dogs are hungry"
      To translate "The dogs are hungry" we made and instatiated the following
         transfwer rule:

      hunger-eats-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
      [ INPUT.RELS < [ PRED "_hungry_a_rel",
                        ARG0 #event,
                        ARG1 #agent ] >,
        OUTPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_hunger_n_rel",
                           LBL #larg,
                           ARG0 #hunger & [NUM sg]],
                        [ PRED "_eat_v_rel",
                           ARG0 #event,
                           ARG1 #hunger,
                           ARG2 #agent ],
                        [ PRED "exist_q_rel",
                           RSTR #harg,
                           ARG0 #hunger ] >,
                 HCONS < [HARG #harg,
                           LARG #larg] > ] ].

   16: _in_p_rel > _loc_p_rel
      Titan has a generic purpose preposition, so we intantiated in-loc-mtr.
