1 Improving MT Coverage

25: Manuai i matir alan muiny i matir.
   Previously, sentence 25 generated four results, each with 'alan' at the beginning of the sentence:
      *Alan   manuai i        matir muiny i        matir.
      Because cat    3sg.real sleep dog   3sg.real sleep
      Because the cat sleeps, the dog sleeps.
   
   To fix this, we changed from this rule:
      realis-clause-init-prehead-s-attach-subord-lex-item := subord-with-verbal-comp-lex &
         ...
         INIT +
   
   to:
      realis-clause-final-prehead-s-attach-subord-lex-item := subord-with-verbal-comp-lex &
         ...
         INIT -
   
   We removed 2 of the ambiguous sentences by specifying that the MOD value
      must be FORM finite.

3 Residual Ambiguity

===============================================================================
4 Transfer Rules
    6:
       "think" and "know" > "va" (think/know)
    15:
       "hunger eats the dogs" > "the dogs are hungry"
    16:
       _in_p_rel > _loc_p_rel
    20, 21, 22:
       wh_q_rel > which_q_rel

       'you' in English could be singular or plural. 
    4: 1 result
       good results
    5: 2 results
       Both results are good, one has bi-partite negationa and the
       the other has simple negation
    6: 0 results
       SKIPPED in ttv, we need transfer rules from "think" and "know" to
       "va" (think/know)

       SKIPPED in ttv
    8: 1 results
       Correct result.
    9: 1 results
       Correct results.

       Both results are correct, ambiguity scope of verbal clitic.
    11: 1 results
       Correct result.
    12: 0 results
       SKIPPED in ttv, we are missing attributive adjectives.
    15: 0 results
       We are missing a transfwer rule for "hunger eats the dogs".
    16: 0 results
       We are missing a transfer rule for _in_p_rel to _loc_p_rel.
    17: 1 result
       Correct results.
    18: 0 results (SKIPPED in ttv)
       The general preposition 'e' used for poesssion currently has the pred
       val _loc_p_rel. We'll need to add another lexical entry for
       'e' to handle poss_rel.
    19: 1 result
       Correct result, however, we expect 2 results. The pronominal
       possesive suffix has two alternating forms, '-yo' and
       '-eyo'. Currently only '-yo' shows up.
    20: 0 results
       wh_q_rel is not covered. Instead, we have which_q_rel. We can fix
       this with a transfer rule.
    21: 0 results
       wh_q_rel is not covered. Instead, we have which_q_rel. We can fix
       this with a transfer rule.
    22: 0 results
       wh_q_rel is not covered. Instead, we have which_q_rel. We can fix
          this with a transfer rule.
   22: 0 results
      wh_q_rel is not covered. Instead, we have which_q_rel. We can fix
      this with a transfer rule.
   23: 0 results (error) (SKIPPED in ttv)
      We got an error: atomic_dg: no such type as 'past'. We suspected we
         could find a fix for this in semi.vpm, but Titan has no
         tense.
   24: 0 results (error) (SKIPPED in ttv)
      We got the same error as in 23.
   25: 4 results
      'Alan' (because) ought to be at the end of the sentence, but all
         results have it at the beginning. Additionaly, two of the
         reults have the subject and object swapped, and IN_SITU_QUES
         applies to the topmost S. 
   26: 0 results
      SKIPPED in ttv, we are missing a word for "after".

5.2 sje to eng

       One good translation, one bad translation with semantics that
       means "They eat dogs":
          "ala ani muiny"
    5: 2 results
       Both results are good, one has bi-partite negationa and the
          the other has simple negation
    6: 0 results
       SKIPPED in ttv, we need transfer rules from "think" and "know" to
          "va" (think/know)
    7: 0 results
       SKIPPED in ttv
    8: 2 results (with same surface string)
       Because we allow nouns to be standalone sentences and because
          there sentences can be coordinated, there is ambiguiy
          about the consituant structure of the daughters of
          coordination. We aren't sure why sje>ttv has this
          ambiguity and eng>ttv doesn't.
    9: 1 results
       Correct result.
    10: 4 results.
       Two results are correct, and in the two bad results, the subject of
          one of the coordinated verbs is dropped.
    11: 1 results
      Correct result.
    12: 0 results
      SKIPPED in ttv, we are missing attributive adjectives.
    13: 0 results
       We are missing a transfer rule for _in_p_rel to _loc_p_rel.
