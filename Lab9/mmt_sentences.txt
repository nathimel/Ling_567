================================================================================
This file is a report on the MMT sentences that will be pasted into the writeup.
The report on each sentence should be informative but brief; I think the best
way to do this is to report:
    1. The output of each sentence from the final Lab 7 grammar
       1.1 For ttv to ttv
       1.2 For eng to ttv
       1.3 And sje to ttv
    2. A prose description of the issues with the output for each
    3. The relevant tdl in the final Lab 8 grammar for each sentence
    4. The final output numbers.:

================================================================================
1
Dogs sleep
Muiny ala matir.
Bednaga urri

		The general preposition 'e' used for poesssion currently has the pred
			val _loc_p_rel. We'll need to add another lexical entry for
			'e' to handle poss_rel.
	19: 1 result
		Correct result, however, we expect 2 results. The pronominal
			possesive suffix has two alternating forms, '-yo' and
			'-eyo'. Currently only '-yo' shows up.
	20: 0 results

		We got the same error as in 23.
	25: 4 results
		'Alan' (because) ought to be at the end of the sentence, but all

	8: 2 results (with same surface string)
		Because we allow nouns to be standalone sentences and because
			there sentences can be coordinated, there is ambiguiy
			about the consituant structure of the daughters of
			coordination. We aren't sure why sje>ttv has this
			ambiguity and eng>ttv doesn't.
	9: 1 results
		Correct parse.
