Lab 7
by David Krug and Nathanial Imel

On monday I will study the titan DR for non-verbal predicates and
   try to come up with testsuite examples.

Lab7/ttv_initial = Lab6/ttv_final
   But Lab7/ttv_initial/tsdb/home still has the four tsdb profiles from lab 6.

To do:
   non-verbal predicates
      learn how they work
         nouns, adjectives, adpositions
      make testsuite examples
      implement them using TDL
         this requires implementing PPs (if titan has them)
      test our implementation by parsing the testsuite examples
   machine translation/other testing
      translate lines 15-17 in ttv.txt
      test translation of those lines
      test wh questions in non-verbal predicate sentences   
   grammar comparisions
      run the final grammar with the testsuite/test corpus
   other small fixes
      double check that semantical-empty entries and spurious pronouns are ALL gone
      spell out the rest of semi.vpm
      change nfut/fut to real/irr in testsuite.txt
   finish the writeup
      what if we put the writeup through a spell checker

Questions for Emily:
   none yet

Table of contents (idk if this structure makes sense; it might change):
   1 Noun predicates
      1.1 how they work in Titan (with IGT)
      1.2 how we implemented them
   2 Adjective predicates
      2.1 how they work in Titan (with IGT)
      2.2 how we implemented them
   3 PP predicates
      3.1 how they work in Titan (with IGT)
      3.2 how we implemented them
   4 Non-verbal predicate testing
      4.1 translation for lines 15-17 in ttv.txt and translation testing
      4.2 testing wh questions in non-verbal predicate sentences
   5 Small changes
      any thing else we change in the grammar that is worth writing up

6 Grammar comparision
6.1 Testsuite
   6.1.1 Initial grammar (copied from lab 6)
      56/88 positive items parsed (63.6% coverage)
      6/77 negative items parsed (7.8 overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         positive items that parsed had 1.11 parses.
         negative itmes that parsed had 1.00 parses
      
      The most ambiguous item had 3 parses:
         Ala      kip.
         3pl.real lie
         They lied.
      See lab 6 for an explination of the ambiguity.

   6.1.2 Final grammar
      #/# items parsed.
      #/# positive items parsed (#% coverage)
      #/# negative items parsed (#% overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         Positive items that parsed had # parses.
         Negative items that parsed had # parses.
      
      The most ambiguous items had # parses:
         <IGT>
      <explanation of the ambiguity>

6.2 Test corpus
   6.2.1 Initial grammar (copied from lab 6)
      29/562 items parsed (5.2% coverage)
      
      On average, parsed items had 1.45 prases
      
      The most ambiguous item had 3 parses:
         ala      va  yota     ka  mulie
         3pl.real say 1pl.incl irr run
         They said lets turn around
      See lab 6 for an explanation of the ambiguity.

   6.2.2 Final grammar
      #/# items parsed (#% coverage)
      
      On average, parsed items had # parses.
      
      The most ambiguous item had # parses:
         <IGT>
      <explanation of the ambiguity>
