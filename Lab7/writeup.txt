	Lab 7
by David Krug and Nathanial Imel

On monday I will study the titan DR for non-verbal predicates and
   try to come up with testsuite examples.

Lab7/ttv_initial = Lab6/ttv_final
   But Lab7/ttv_initial/tsdb/home still has the four tsdb profiles from lab 6.

To do:
   non-verbal predicates
      learn how they work
         nouns, adjectives, adpositions
      make testsuite examples
      implement them using TDL
         this requires implementing PPs (if titan has them)
      test our implementation by parsing the testsuite examples
   machine translation/other testing
      translate lines 15-17 in ttv.txt
      test translation of those lines
      test wh questions in non-verbal predicate sentences   
   grammar comparisions
      run the final grammar with the testsuite/test corpus
   other small fixes
      double check that semantical-empty entries and spurious pronouns are ALL gone
      _pron_n_rel -> pron_rel
   finish the writeup
      what if we put the writeup through a spell checker

Previously we said Titan doesn't have a determiner to mark for definiteness, but
   I found this on page 31 of the DR:
   I   ta      dongoanpala moen cinal
   3sg measure head.shape  def  devil
   He measured the head-shape of the devil
We might need to change our MMT translations.

Questions for Emily:
   we don't have unary-phrase
   ask about pg 61 5.1.1
   adposition-subord-lex-item

Table of contents (idk if this structure makes sense; it might change):
   1 Noun predicates
      1.1 how they work in Titan (with IGT)
      1.2 how we implemented them
   2 Adjective predicates
      2.1 how they work in Titan (with IGT)
      2.2 how we implemented them
   3 PP predicates
      3.1 how they work in Titan (with IGT)
      3.2 how we implemented them
   4 Non-verbal predicate testing
      4.1 translation for lines 15-17 in ttv.txt and translation testing
      4.2 testing wh questions in non-verbal predicate sentences
   5 Small changes
      any thing else we change in the grammar that is worth writing up
   6 Grammar comparision
      6.1 Testsuite
         6.1.1 Initial grammar
         6.1.2 Final grammar
      6.2 Test corpus
         6.2.1 Initial grammar
         6.2.2 Final grammar

===============================================================================
1 Noun predicates
1.1 How they work
oi cinal
2sg devil
You are a devil

?oi a cinal
2sg 2sg.real devil
You are a devil.

1.2 How we implemented them

===============================================================================
2 Adjective predicates
2.1 How they work
   Some adjectives can appear in verbal slots, with the agreement clitic:
      Lodianum ei i likom.
      house-inside 2sg.ps 2sg be.pitch-dark
      The inside of her house was pitch black.

   Some adjectives can appear in nominal slots, modifying "either as modifier
      of a null head, or a noun (i don't understand this, even after reading
      footnote 42)
      
      i   madean i   vai ila te  i    riin, i   va...
      3sg big    3sg say to      3sg  small 3sg say
      The big person said to the small one...
      
      Cilim    i   ti      madean
      Starling 3sg be.near big
      The starling was near the big [drum].
   
   The agreement clitics do not appear with non-third person subjects and adjectives:
      *oi a        muan
      2sg 2sg.real bad
      You are bad
      
      Oi  muan
      3sg bad
      You are bad
    
   Predicative adjectives do not appear in irrealis or perfective clauses:
      *manuai ki      muan
      osprey  3sg.irr bad
      The osprey is bad

2.2 How we implemented them

===============================================================================
3 PP predicates
3.1 How they work
nat   e  wei  poen
child in that not
The child is not in that [basket].

3.2 How we implemented them

===============================================================================
4 Non-verbal predicate testing

===============================================================================
5 Small miscellaneous changes

For the spurious pronouns cleanup, deleted noun41 to noun82 EXCEPT
noun48 and noun82. Here's an example of one of the pronouns deleted:

  noun41_name=noun41
  noun41_pron=on
    noun41_feat1_name=number
    noun41_feat1_value=du
  noun41_det=opt
    noun41_stem1_orth=damolou
    noun41_stem1_pred=_pron_n_rel

Deleted the alternate spelling on 'pa' as 'poa' and instead added a new lex.
entry for 'poa' that had the appropriate 2sg agreement (w/ subject) features.

In our testsuite.txt, we changed mood glosses from nfut/fut to real/irr.
   This is to reflect our analysis that Titan does not have tense, only mood.

We finished spellling out some properites in semi.vpm.

6 Grammar comparision
6.1 Testsuite
   6.1.1 Initial grammar (copied from lab 6)
      56/88 positive items parsed (63.6% coverage)
      6/77 negative items parsed (7.8 overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         positive items that parsed had 1.11 parses.
         negative itmes that parsed had 1.00 parses
      
      The most ambiguous item had 3 parses:
         Ala      kip.
         3pl.real lie
         They lied.
      See lab 6 for an explination of the ambiguity.

   6.1.2 Final grammar
      #/# items parsed.
      #/# positive items parsed (#% coverage)
      #/# negative items parsed (#% overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         Positive items that parsed had # parses.
         Negative items that parsed had # parses.
      
      The most ambiguous items had # parses:
         <IGT>
      <explanation of the ambiguity>

6.2 Test corpus
   6.2.1 Initial grammar (copied from lab 6)
      29/562 items parsed (5.2% coverage)
      
      On average, parsed items had 1.45 prases
      
      The most ambiguous item had 3 parses:
         ala      va  yota     ka  mulie
         3pl.real say 1pl.incl irr run
         They said lets turn around
      See lab 6 for an explanation of the ambiguity.

   6.2.2 Final grammar
      #/# items parsed (#% coverage)
      
      On average, parsed items had # parses.
      
      The most ambiguous item had # parses:
         <IGT>
      <explanation of the ambiguity>
