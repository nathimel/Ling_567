Lab 4 Write-Up
by Nathaniel Imel and David Krug

===================================================================================================
From the lab 3 grammar to this intial lab 4 grammar, we changed:
 -  
From the initial grammar to the final grammar, we changed:
 - 
===================================================================================================

1. Initial and final [incr tsdb()] runs results for test corpus and test suite
	1.1.initial, testsuite
		 

	1.1.2 average number of parses per parsed item: 1.57
	1.1.3 Most ambiguous example received: 2
	1.1.4 Ambiguity:
		
	1.2 initial, corpus (using i-length < 8
		1.2.1 How many items parsed? 24 out of 563 (4.3%)
		1.2.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item? 1.50
		1.2.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
		      
		1.2.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	
	1.3 final, corpus
	
	1.4 final, testsuite

		1.4.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item?

		1.4.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?

		1.4.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?

===================================================================================================

2. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in
the semantics?

    1. Initial test suite run: 

    2. Final run diff:

3. Documentation of the phenomena you have added to your testsuite
We added:
- wh- questions

  

- embedded complement clauses

  We added two verbs, 'pa ~ poa' and 'va.'

  'Va' usually means say:

       (a) Ato va  Oi  a        kip
           3pc say 2sg 2sg.nfut lie
	   'They said, "You're lying!"'

       (b) Colai i  va   Dangan ne kip
       	   C    3sg say  truth  or lie
	   'Colai said, "Is this the truth or a lie?"'

  It embeds questions. I have searched the corpora for questions (constructed with wh- words and with
  the form 'X or Y?') and noticed that if 'va' embeds an irrealis-marked clause, it's usually following
  a previous clause that isn't marked for irrealis. That is, I haven't seen examples of the form:
  'X asked "where will we go' straight out, only things like the following example. I'm not sure
  how much exactly is being embedded in the following examples.

       Ala lemetani i ala va Pamei Yota ka mat, yota ka le ee?
       3pl ask-trans 3sg 3pl say P  1pl.inc nsg.fut go.to where
       'They asked her, "Pamei! When we die, where will we go?" (p. 403)

       I   yuyuu i  va  Yaye   pe  dasi    yo  ku      au     e   tite  kua   varina  waru
       3sg call 3sg say mother and brother 1sg 1sg.fut leave from where there to      2dl
       'He called and said, "My mother and brother! How will I get up to you?"'

  And interestingly, when its embedded clause marked irrealis, 'ka' can mean 'want':

  	 Alu i va Kalomat yo va ku le Moanus
	 alu 3sg say K       1sg want 1sg.fut go.to M
	 'Alu said, "Kalomat! I want to go to Manus."'

  But the converse does not hold:

     	 Kalomat i   va ku  sui        palenkei"
	 K       3sg say imp scrape.off  sago-leaf.ribs
	 'Kalomat said, "Scrape off sago-leaf ribs!"'

  We are still searching the corpora provided, but we wonder whether an individual might
  say something with future or other irrealis marking, but doesn't want the clause to be true,
  like the following contrived example:

      	 Manuai va  yo  ku      mat
	 Eagle  say 1sg 1sg.fut die
	 'Eagle said, "I will die."'

  Maybe we could write two lexical entries for 'va,' and then get ambiguity if we ever see it taking
  a clause with irrealis marking. But perhaps that's too strong a claim that there is genuine
  ambiguity in such sentences?

  And then there is the verb 'pa ~ poa' which only means 'want' -- Claire Bowern calls it a
  desiderative marker. It is
  
  	       "preceded by an optional subject agreement clitic, and the main
  	       lexical verb denoting the action desired is preceded by the irrealis clitic, which agrees
 	        with the subject of the whole clause. (p. 152) And there are no examples of the desiderative
		where the subject of wanting and the subject of the lexical verb are different; i.e., none
		of the form 'X wants Y to do something.' (p.456).

  Bowern uses the following two examples to illustrate apparent optionality of the subject agreement
  marker.

	(a) Yo  pa   ku  le  Yap.
	    1sg want 1sg.fut go.to Yap
	    'I want to go to Yap.'

	(b) Hi Moi i   pa   ki       nyak   ile polenpongopong.
	    H.M.  3sg  want 3sg.fut  climb  into peak-pandanus-palm
	    'Hi Moi wanted to climb to the top of a pandanus palm.'

		In (a), the desiderative is preceded only by the first free person singular pronoun 'yo';
 		there is no agreement marker 'u' present. In (b), however, an agreement marker 'i' is present.
		There is no discernable conditioning factor in the data, although it is always absent with
		first and second person singular subjects. (ibid)


- adverbial clausal modifiers

  We added the adverbial modifier 'alan.' It appears at the end of the matrix clause, just before
  the subordinate clause. We are unclear on whether this means the modifier is a constituent of the
  embedded subordinate clause or not.

  	   # XX: alan in irrealis marks conditional
	   Source: author
	   Vetted: f
 	   Judgment: g
           Oi ko kip alan yo ku kip
           2sg 2sg.fut lie if 1sg 1sg.fut lie
           'If you will lie, I will lie.'

  Bowern says that 'alan' is almost always found with the subordinate marked for irrealis; there
  is one occurrence that she found where the subordinate is realis, and there it means 'because.'

     	   # XX: alan in realis as because
	   Source: author
	   Vetted: f
	   Judgment: g
	   Yo ulumui das alan, das i camar
	   1sg drink sea because sea 3sg dry.up
	   'Because I drank the sea, the sea water has dried up.'

4. Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated in your test suite but not covered
by your starter grammar and/or the customization system. (This can be brief if you like: e.g.
"We added wh questions to the test suite, but didn't work on implementing them this week.")

===================================================================================================

5. If you have identified ways (other than those you already reported) in which the automatically
created choices file is particularly off-base, please report them here. If you can include IGT from
the testsuite or your descriptive materials illustrating the problem, that is even better.
