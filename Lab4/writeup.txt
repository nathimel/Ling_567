Lab 4 Write-Up
by Nathaniel Imel and David Krug

===================================================================================================
From the lab 3 grammar to this intial lab 4 grammar, we changed:
 -  
From the initial grammar to the final grammar, we changed:
 - 
===================================================================================================

1. Initial and final [incr tsdb()] runs results for test corpus and test suite
	1.1.initial, testsuite
	1.1.2 average number of parses per parsed item: 1.57
	1.1.3 Most ambiguous example received: 2
	1.1.4 Ambiguity:
		
	1.2 initial, corpus (using i-length < 8
		1.2.1 How many items parsed? 24 out of 563 (4.3%)
		1.2.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item? 1.50
		1.2.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
		1.2.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	
	1.3 final, corpus
	
	1.4 final, testsuite

		1.4.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item?

		1.4.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?

		1.4.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?

===================================================================================================

2. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in
the semantics?

    1. Initial test suite run: 
    2. Final run diff:

3. Documentation of the phenomena you have added to your testsuite
We added:
- wh- questions

  Wh-questions were illuminating because they showed that sentences
  don't need a verb. In fact, Claire Bowern says on p. 139 of the
  descriptive resources that

  	'not all clauses have verbs, and there
	appears to be no copula in Titan, and that a predicate can be a
	noun, as in the equative sentences "he's a snake".'

  So we plan to write test cases for sentences of the form:

      "Oi cinal"
      2sg devil
      'You're a devil.'

  in the next lab and implement this phenomena as soon as possible. Therefore,
  we want to keep our test cases for wh-questions of the form

     (PRO)NOUN WH-PRONOUN
  
  Titan has the following interrogative pronouns:

     	  Titan	     English gloss
     	  ca   	     what
	  se	     what
	  tavai	     who
	  (t)ite     where
	  (ke)rehe   to where
	  wei, wee   to where
	  (a)keis    when(fut only)
	  e ca	     how (with what)
	  (y)etepe   for what [purpose]
	  (ta)ce     how many
	  tapeta     how much

  Test cases for 'ca':

       Judgment: g
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}

       'What are you eating?'

       Se i nyamiri oi
       who 3sg love 2sg
       'Who loves you?'

 Test cases for 'ite' and 'tite' were the same:

       # ite in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: g
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       Oi pin ite
       2sg woman where
       'You're a woman from where?'

       # ite not in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: u
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       ite oi pin
       where 2sg woman
       'You're a woman from where?'

  We only found 'rehe' and not 'kerehe'

       # rehe in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: g
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       Manuai rehe
       eagle where
       'Where is the eagle?'

       # rehe in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: g
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       Manuai i la rehe
       eagle 3sg go where
       'Where did the eagle go?'

       # rehe not in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: u
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       rehe manuai i la
       where eagle 3sg go
       'Where did the eagle go?'

       # etepe in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: g
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       Oi etepe
       2sg how.is.it
       'How are you?'

       # etepe not in situ
       Source: author
       Vetted: f
       Judgment: g
       Phenomena: {wh-questions}
       etepe oi
       how.is.it 2sg
       'How are you?'

  There were no examples of (ta)ce. We found two examples of 'tapeta' but they were much too
  complicated to use, even for reverse engineering test cases.

  There was only one example of 'tavai' = who, but it was too complicated to use:

  	papu-n      i  va  ane     tavai amo  pein  yo  pasan      poen
	father-3sg 3sg say perhaps who   some woman 1sg know_about not
	'Father said, "Perhaps who? Some woman? I don't know anything about it."'

  Since we don't have a lexical entry for the preposition 'e', we won't write
  test cases for 'e ca' in this lab. We hope to implement the preposition and its
  possessive version in a future lab.

     Moe ramat  i   va  e    ca   ito  a pulpul, a pulpul
     def person 3sg say pred what this a pulpul a pulpul
    'The person said, "And what's this, a pulpul, a pulpul?"'


  From the corpora, have the following two examples of 'keis' = when:

     Ala ka      me   keis
     3pl nsg.fut come when
     'When will they come back?'

     oi ani yo akeis
     2sg eat 1sg when
     'When do you eat me?'

  We found no examples of 'wei' as an interrogative pronoun, but 'wee' is one. It
  seems to require a verb such as 'la' to precede it, though we don't have that
  high-frequency verb in our lexicon yet. All examples of 'wee' in the corpora
  were of the form:

     Moen Hus i  va  ato la wee
     def  H  3sg say 3pc be where
    'The man from Hus said, "where are they?"'

     Pati eoi    i   la wee
     wife 2sg.ps 3sg be where
     'Where are your wives?'

     Ni    eoi, [relative clause] i   la wee
     fish 2sg.ps	  	  3sg go where
     'Your fish  ...          where did they go?'
  
  We don't have test cases for 'sa' = what, because the only example has it occuring
  in a phrase where there are a number of unexplained words:

    i   va Dayebui i  su   kut pe ya  kara sa
    3sg say D     3sg flow ?? and def ??   what
    'He said, "Menstrual blood is flowing, and what is it?"'

- embedded complement clauses
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  We added two verbs, 'pa ~ poa' and 'va.'

  'Va' usually means say:

       (a) Ato va  Oi  a        kip
           3pc say 2sg 2sg.nfut lie
	   'They said, "You're lying!"'

       (b) Colai i  va   Dangan ne kip
       	   C    3sg say  truth  or lie
	   'Colai said, "Is this the truth or a lie?"'

  It embeds questions. I have searched the corpora for questions (constructed with wh- words and with
  the form 'X or Y?') and noticed that if 'va' embeds an irrealis-marked clause, it's usually following
  a previous vocative. That is, I haven't seen examples of the form: 'X asked "where will we go'
  straight out, only things like the following examples.

       Ala lemetani  i   ala va  Pamei Yota    ka      mat, yota    ka      le    ee?
       3pl ask-trans 3sg 3pl say P     1pl.inc nsg.fut die  1pl.inc nsg.fut go.to where
       'They asked her, "Pamei! When we die, where will we go?" (p. 403)

       I   yuyuu i  va  Yaye   pe  dasi    yo  ku      au     e   tite  kua   varina  waru
       3sg call 3sg say mother and brother 1sg 1sg.fut leave from where there to      2dl
       'He called and said, "My mother and brother! How will I get up to you?"'

  And interestingly, when va's embedded clause is marked irrealis, it can mean 'want':

  	 Alu i va Kalomat yo va ku le Moanus
	 alu 3sg say K       1sg want 1sg.fut go.to M
	 'Alu said, "Kalomat! I want to go to Manus."' (from corpus)

  But the converse does not hold:

     	 Kalomat i   va  ku  sui        palenkei"
	 K       3sg say imp scrape.off  sago-leaf.ribs
	 'Kalomat said, "Scrape off sago-leaf ribs!"' (corpus)

  We wonder whether an individual might say something with future or other irrealis marking,
  but doesn't want the clause to be true, maybe like the following contrived example:

      	 Manuai va  yo  ku      mat
	 Eagle  say 1sg 1sg.fut die
	 'Eagle said, "I will die."' (made-up)

  So we are considering writing two lexical entries for 'va,' but we'd get ambiguity if we ever see it taking
  a clause with irrealis marking. Are we dealing with a genuine ambiguity here, and would it not be worth
  adding a separate lexical entry?

  And then there is the verb 'pa ~ poa' which only means 'want' -- Claire Bowern calls it a
  desiderative marker. It is
  
  	       "preceded by an optional subject agreement clitic, and the main
  	       lexical verb denoting the action desired is preceded by the irrealis clitic, which agrees
 	        with the subject of the whole clause. (p. 152) And there are no examples of the desiderative
		where the subject of wanting and the subject of the lexical verb are different; i.e., none
		of the form 'X wants Y to do something.' (p.456).

  Bowern uses the following two examples to illustrate apparent optionality of the subject agreement
  marker.

	(a) Yo  pa   ku  le  Yap.
	    1sg want 1sg.fut go.to Yap
	    'I want to go to Yap.'

	(b) Hi Moi i   pa   ki       nyak   ile polenpongopong.
	    H.M.  3sg  want 3sg.fut  climb  into peak-pandanus-palm
	    'Hi Moi wanted to climb to the top of a pandanus palm.'

		In (a), the desiderative is preceded only by the first free person singular pronoun 'yo';
 		there is no agreement marker 'u' present. In (b), however, an agreement marker 'i' is present.
		There is no discernable conditioning factor in the data, although it is always absent with
		first and second person singular subjects. (ibid)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- adverbial clausal modifiers

  We added the adverbial modifier 'alan', which means 'if'. It appears at the end of the matrix clause, just before
  the subordinate clause. We are unclear on whether this means the modifier is a constituent of the
  embedded subordinate clause or not.

  	   # XX: alan in irrealis marks conditional
	   Source: author
	   Vetted: f
 	   Judgment: g
           Oi ko kip alan yo ku kip
           2sg 2sg.fut lie if 1sg 1sg.fut lie
           'If you will lie, I will lie.'

  Bowern says that 'alan' is almost always found with the subordinate marked for irrealis; there
  is one occurrence that she found where the subordinate is realis, and there it means 'because.'

     	   # XX: alan in realis as because
	   Source: author
	   Vetted: f
	   Judgment: g
	   Yo ulumui das alan, das i camar
	   1sg drink sea because sea 3sg dry.up
	   'Because I drank the sea, the sea water has dried up.'
