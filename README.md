# Ling_567
latest notes:
note that we didn't actually do anything to improve agreement.
We just added more verbs, that happen to have the same orthography as
what the clitics will be, and even added predications like "3sg". But
we did not make any constraints on their co-occurrence restrictions --
that is to say, beyond their being verby, we contributed nothing to the
syntactic phenomenon of agreement.
