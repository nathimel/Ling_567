Notes on potential improvements:

======================================================================================
'poa' seems to allow non-second person agreement, but it shouldn't.
      i.e., we parsed "Yo poa ku kip"

Also, in the MRS for the sentence above, it seems that MOOD is left underspecified.
Do we maybe want to say in our semi.vpm that when mood is underspecified it should
just be irrealis?
Arguably, this example is strange because 'poa' is a bit peculiar in not requiring
a subject agreement clitic before it, which would constrain the MOOD down to realis or irrealis.

======================================================================================
FIX the damn 45 pron_n_rels. There should only be about 15.
