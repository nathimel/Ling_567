TOOD list

     1. See what Emily has to say about negation
     2. Explore MMT for generation cleanup
     	2.1 Focus on the 46 results we get for 16 ("manuai e lono")
	2.2 > 16 results for 18 -- why is the clitic showing up before "dilen"?
	2.3 Implement possession likke "eyo" -- we have 0 parses so far
	2.4 "kone" keeps showing up, should be an easy fix
	2.5 Why aren't we parsing 25? Check implementation of "alan"
     3. Fix things from last lab, perhaps adjectives? Emily's lab feedback?
===============================================================================
Questions/issues:

	- A large amount of the corpus isn't simple just sentential negation,
	but things like

	    [something NOT ] = nothing
	and negative polarity items ( "ave" = any, "mavuen" = not.yet ), and
	constituent negation. I'm guessing that we won't be implementing these.

	- It seems like modal negation would be nice to implement.
	However, its not in the MMT sentences.

===============================================================================
The MT sentence for negation is:

       "The dogs don't chase cats."

1 Documentation of Negation

  1.1 Overview
  
  - In the section on Negation (9.6 of Titan Grammar), Bowern says this:

      "There are several different forms of negation in Titan, depending on
      whether the clause is indicative or irrealis (that is, whether it contains
      the modal marker k- described in Section 6.3.2 above).
      ...
      "Clauses in the indicative are usually negated by placing "ne" between
      the aspect marker and the main verb and "poen" at the end of the clause.

  -NB: It seems that by "aspect marker", Bowern means one of the clitics, of which
  we've been focusing on irrealis/realis for this quarter.

      (ne between marker/main verb w/ poen at end)

	    i   ne    lis aru poen
	    3sg d.neg see 3dl not
	    "He couldn't see them."

	    aru ne    atinqi ni   poen
	    3dl d.neg strike fish not
	    "They didn't strike fish."

      Occasionally, "poen" may be used alone, either when the clause is verbless
      or when a main verb is present."

      (Poen only)
      (w/ main verb

      	 Yo  u     pasani     ala poen
	 1sg 1sg.S know.about 3pl not
	 "I know nothing about them."

       (non-verbal predicate)

         Amo    pein  poen
	 indef  woman not
	 "There weren't any women."


      The conditioning factor here could be that the scope of negation is a
      single argument rather than the entire clause.

  - Actually, we found it helpful to study the beginning of the Verb Clauses
  section, too:

     "The verbal complex comprises the matrix verb root and a number of
     clitics which give information about the tesnse, aspect, mood, and
     subject of the clause. The basic structure of the core verb unit is:

     	     (Neg) TAM-person (V_TAM) V

     "The TAM marker is bound to the subject-agreement markers, and primarily
     signals a split between realis, irrealis, and perfective. Further
     specification of tense, aspect, or associated motion is achieved by
     means of serial verbs."

  - A large amount of negation in the corpus is in irrealis, which is marked
  by a different item, "nabu". It generally appears first in the clause,
  before the verb but after the subject. Negative commands also appear with
  "nabu."

    (initial in a modal clause)
      {IGT}

    (negative command)
      {IGT}
      
  - Claire Bowern also discusses constituent negation, but since that isn't
  in the MMT sentences, we decided not to implement it.
     - Consequences of this decision (analysis) ?
     - i.e., what will the semantics look like, if any, for constituent negation
     since we're not explicitly working on it?

===============================================================================
2 Implementation

  2.1 Prose Description of the implemented analysis

  2.2 Specific tdl (pasted)

      The initial grammar has the following lexical entries:

       poen := neg11-aux-lex &
	 [ STEM < "poen" >,
	   SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "neg_rel" ].

	ne := neg12-aux-lex &
	  [ STEM < "ne" >,
	    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "neg_rel" ].

      This is currently having the effect that we parse most of the negative
      examples, and none of the positive ones. The words are acting as we'd
      expect an auxiliary to act. For example, we get:

      	     *Manuai ne kip
	     cat    neg lie

and
      	     *Manuai poen kip
	     cat    neg lie

	     The MRS shows: it's not the case (qeq) that some cat lies.
	     We suppose that's a reasonable
	     semantics, but of course this string is not grammatical in Titan
	     because the agreement marker is missing, and the negative item
	     "poen" is not at the end of the clause as it should be.

This parsed:

      	     *Manuai ne poen kip
	     cat    neg neg  lie

	     The MRS is what we'd expect given the previous two: it's not
	     the case that it's not the case that some cat lies.

Question:
	There seems to tbe scope ambiguity here.
	It seems like we want: Exists(x)( Cat(x) ^ ~Lie(x) )
	But I'm worried we're getting/how to block:
	    		       ~Exists(x)( Cat(x) ^ Lie(x) )

  2.3 IGT for testing the analysis

      Thinking of writing test cases like the following for sentential negation:

      Manuai i   ne  kip poen
      cat    3sg neg lie not
      "The cat didn't lie."

      Manuai i kip   poen
      cat    3sg lie not
      "The cat didn't lie."

      *Manuai ne  i   kip poen
       cat    neg 3sg lie not
       "The cat didnt' lie."

      *Manuai i   ne  kip
      cat     3sg neg lie
      "The cat didn't lie."

      *Manuai i   kip ne
       cat    3sg lie neg
       "The cat didnt' lie."

(e.g.,

  n. Works! With # of outputs.
  n. Doesn't work. MRSes are different, documenting these differences.
