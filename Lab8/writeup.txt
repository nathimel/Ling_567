1 Documentation of Negation

  1.1 Overview
  
  - In the section on Negation (9.6 of Titan Grammar), Bowern says this:

      "There are several different forms of negation in Titan, depending on
      whether the clause is indicative or irrealis (that is, whether it contains
      the modal marker k- described in Section 6.3.2 above).
      ...
      "Clauses in the indicative are usually negated by placing "ne" between
      the aspect marker and the main verb and "poen" at the end of the clause.

  -NB: It seems that by "aspect marker", Bowern means one of the clitics, of which
  we've been focusing on irrealis/realis for this quarter.

      (ne between marker/main verb w/ poen at end)

	    i   ne    lis aru poen
	    3sg d.neg see 3dl not
	    "He couldn't see them."

	    aru ne    atinqi ni   poen
	    3dl d.neg strike fish not
	    "They didn't strike fish."

      Occasionally, "poen" may be used alone, either when the clause is verbless
      or when a main verb is present."

      (Poen only)
      (w/ main verb

      	 Yo  u     pasani     ala poen
	 1sg 1sg.S know.about 3pl not
	 "I know nothing about them."

       (non-verbal predicate)

         Amo    pein  poen
	 indef  woman not
	 "There weren't any women."


      The conditioning factor here could be that the scope of negation is a
      single argument rather than the entire clause.

  - Actually, we found it helpful to study the beginning of the Verb Clauses
  section, too:

     "The verbal complex comprises the matrix verb root and a number of
     clitics which give information about the tesnse, aspect, mood, and
     subject of the clause. The basic structure of the core verb unit is:

     	     (Neg) TAM-person (V_TAM) V

     "The TAM marker is bound to the subject-agreement markers, and primarily
     signals a split between realis, irrealis, and perfective. Further
     specification of tense, aspect, or associated motion is achieved by
     means of serial verbs."

2 Implementation

  2.0 MMT sentence:

       "The dogs don't chase cats."
       
        Muiny ala        ne  voliliti manuai poen
	Dog   3pl.realis neg chase    cat    neg

	or
	Muiny ala        voliliti manuai poen
	Dog   3pl.realis chase    cat    neg


  2.1 Prose Description of the implemented analysis
  
      There are two strategies; bipartite and simple. The bipartite strategy
      corresponds to sentences like "Manuai i ne kip poen", with "ne" as a
      negative auxiliary that's semantically contentful, and "poen" as a
      semantically empty required complement of "ne".

      The simple strategy corresponds to sentences like "manuai i kip poen",
      where "poen" is the semantically contentful negation marker.

3 Further Generation Cleanup (to get generation down to a reasonable output #)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3.1 For sentence 1 (dogs sleep), we initially got the following output from eng to ttv:

	Muiny ka matir
	Muiny matir
	Muiny ala matir

	'Ka' is an irrealis clitic, so we changed our semi.vpm file to have a default:
	       realis <> [e]

	This translation shouldn't have the nominal predicate sentence "muiny matir". So
	to make agreement clitics obligatory, we said our root condition must be FORM finite,
	and that all the main-verb-lex's (and the neg-aux-lex) were FORM nonfinite. Note that
	subj-raise-aux-lex, which is pasted in the above section on negation, requires FORM
	finite.


	main-verb-lex := verb-lex & basic-verb-lex & basic-non-wh-word-lex &
	  [ SYNSEM [ L-QUE -,
		     LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD [ FORM nonfinite,
					  AUX - ],
				   VAL [ SPEC < >,
					 SUBJ < #subj > ] ],
			     CONT.HOOK.XARG #xarg ] ],
	    ARG-ST.FIRST #subj &
			 [ LOCAL [ CAT cat-sat &
				       [ VAL [ SPR < >,
					       COMPS < > ] ],
				   CONT.HOOK.INDEX #xarg ] ] ].

	root := sign &
	  [ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL non-local-none,
		     LOCAL [ COORD -,
			     CAT [ VAL [ SUBJ < >,
					 COMPS < > ],
				   MC +,
				   HEAD +vp &
					[ FORM finite ] ] ] ] ].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.2 For sentence 3 (I chase you) we got the following initial output from eng to ttv:

	Yo kune voliliti oi
	Yo ku voliliti oi
	Yo voliliti awa
	Yo ku voliliti awa
	Yo u voliliti oi
	Yo kune voliliti awa
	Yo u voliliti awa
	Yo voliliti oi

	'Kune' is a perfective marker. So we added the default in semi.vpm:
	  ipfv <> [e]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.3 For sentence 5 (Dogs don't chase cats) we got the following output from eng to ttv:

	Muiny poen voliliti dilen
	Muiny poen ala voliliti dilen
	Muiny poen ka voliliti dilen
	Muiny nabu voliliti dilen
	Muiny nabu ka voliliti dilen
	Muiny nabu ala voliliti dilen

	  We deleted the lexical entry for "nabu," which is the irrealis negation marker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.4 For sentence 8, (Dogs and cats chase cars), we got the following output from eng to ttv:

	Manuai pe muiny awa voliliti dilen
	Manuai pe muiny ala voliliti dilen
	Manuai ne muiny yota voliliti dilen
	Manuai pe muiny ka voliliti dilen
	Manuai ne muiny voliliti dilen
	Manuai pe muiny voliliti dilen
	Manuai ne muiny awa voliliti dilen
	Manuai ne muiny ka voliliti dilen
	Manuai pe muiny yoya voliliti dilen
	Manuai ne muiny ala voliliti dilen
	Manuai ne muiny yoya voliliti dilen
	Manuai pe muiny yota voliliti dilen

	   The fact that we get every plural agreement clitic, but not just
	   the 3rd and plural agreement clitic, had to do with the PNG features
	   not being copied up from the daughter of the np-coord rule. We answered
	   some questions in the Coordination section of the customization website
	   called "feature resolution," which gave us the following tdl to port into
	   our grammar:

	  ;;; Feature Resolution Rules

	  any-3rd-3rd-per-coord-rule := coord-phrase &
	    [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PER 3rd,
	      RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PER 3rd ].

	     ... more combinations, etc ...

	  pass-up-png-coord-rule := bottom-coord-phrase &
	    [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG #png,
	      NONCONJ-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG #png ].

	  ;;; Coordination Strategy 1

	  np1-any-3rd-3rd-any-pl-pl-top-coord-rule := basic-np-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule & any-3rd-3rd-per-coord-rule & any-pl-pl-num-coord-rule &
	    [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].

	     ... more combinations, etc ...

	And we added the appropriate rules in rules.tdl.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	3.5 For sentence 10 (Cats chase dogs and sleep), we got the following
	output from eng to ttv:

	Manuai ka voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ka voliliti muiny pe ala matir
	Manuai ala ka voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ka ka voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ala voliliti muiny pe ala matir
	Manuai ka voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai voliliti muiny pe ka matir
	Manuai ka voliliti muiny pe ka matir
	Manuai ka voliliti muiny pe ka matir
	Manuai ala voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ala ka voliliti muiny pe ala matir
	Manuai voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ala voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ka ala voliliti muiny pe ka matir
	Manuai ala ala voliliti muiny pe ala matir
	Manuai ka ka voliliti muiny pe ka matir
	Manuai ka ala voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ala voliliti muiny pe ka matir
	Manuai voliliti muiny pe ala matir
	Manuai ala ala voliliti muiny pe matir
	Manuai ala voliliti muiny pe ala matir

	   Issues like "ala ala" showing up were fixed by requiring that "ala"
	   require a FORM nonfinite
	   complement.  

          aux9-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
	      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.ASPECT pfv,
			       CAT.VAL [ SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd,
										NUM sg ],
					 COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ] ],
		INFLECTED.VERB-PC3-FLAG - ].


  Those were all the sentences we worked on this lab.

5 Grammar comparision
5.1 Testsuite
   5.1.1 Initial grammar
      72/103 positive items parsed (69.9% coverage)
      11/90 negative items parsed (12.2% overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         positive items that parsed had 1.42 parses.
         negative itmes that parsed had 1.27 parses
      
	The results are not different from Lab 7, and we parsed no negation
	cases.

   5.1.2 Final grammar
      69/103 positive items parsed (67.0% coverage)
      6/90 negative items parsed (6.9% overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         Positive items that parsed had 1.30 parses.
         Negative items that parsed had 1.83 parses.
      
      The most ambiguous item is the same as last lab's (4 parses):
      
	 *Manuai i   e    muiny
	 osprey 3sg prep dog
	 "The eagle is on the dog."
 
      See lab 7 for details.	

      The 3 positive sentences we lost from initial to final were:

	 51: Ta kip
	 91: Titan kip
	 151: Oi poa ku kip

      Ta and Titan were nominal, and we shouldn't get NP VP without an
      agreement clitic. Notice 151 is missing an agreement clitic after oi.

      The 5 negative sentences we lost were:

	 84: Yo pe oi i kip
	 155: Oi pa ku kip
	 171: Oi a cinal
	 173: Manuai i muan

      We lost 84 because of the work we did with coordinating NPs on this lab;
      I said that any and X agreement on the daughters results in X on the mother.
      
      We lost 155 because we specified that 'pa' must take a realis complement.
      We lost 171,123 because we said non-verbal predicates shouldn't have
      clitics (although muan should be a stative verb 'be_bad_v_rel' rather than
      the spurious auto-inferred noun that it is currently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 Test corpus
   5.2.1 Initial grammar (copied from lab 7 final)

      44/562 items parsed (7.8% coverage)
      
      On average, parsed items had 1.95 parses. (increase)
      
      The most ambiguous item had 9 parses: (same as Lab 7)

     ala nyak  e  kor  e    ala cinal
     3pl climb to home poss 3pl devil
     They climbed into the devils lair.
    
    See Lab 7 for more discussion about how we haven't handled "e" as a possessive
      strategy yet.

   5.2.2 Final grammar
      38/562 items parsed (6.8% coverage)
      
      On average, parsed items had 1.61 parses.
      
      The most ambiguous items had 8 and 4 parses:


      	  papu-n     i        va  yo poen
	  father-3sg 3sg.real say 1sg not
	  His father said It wasn t me.

      Of these eight sentences, there were four were 'yo' was correctly
	  parsed as a noun, and underwent the np-pred rule. Of those four,
	  only two had the poen ADV attaching before the verb 'va'(to say),
	  while the others combined with the VP "va yo", which seems incorrect.
	  The two that attached in the right place had great semantics: the
	  ARG2 of say_v_rel is qeq IDed with the neg_rel, which has its ARG1
	  qeq ID'ed with the LBL of the be_v_id rel, which itself has the
	  pronoun's ARG0 as its ARG2. Also, we seem to be getting two copies
	  of each tree and we don't know why. 

      	  Cavomu kor  e    moat
	  C      land poss snake
	  There was a snake in Cavomu.

      Of the 4 trees, three have kor taking the PP complement. Of those,
	  one has kor as an N, one as an NP, and one as a VP (np-pred rule).
	  The one where kor does not take a PP comp is where it is a VP, as
	  a result of the np-pred rule -- and its subject is Cavomu.
	  We think none of these trees are correct, becuase kor is a noun
	  that just means land, so we think it should be perhaps modifying
	  Cavomu.
	  

	  ala pas  e  kapet
	  3pl know of large_fishing_net
	  They know how to use large fishing nets.

      These parses show pas as a noun, but it is a transitive verb. There's
	  lots of ambiguity wrt where that N and the PP combine, but the trees
	  are spurious anyway.
