by Nathaniel Imel and David Krug

There should be four tsdb profiles in tsdb/home:
   lab_8_initial_corpus - Test corpus with initial grammar
   lab_8_initial_ts     - Testssuite with initial grammar
   lab_8_final_corpus   - Test corpus with final grammar
   lab_8_final_ts       - Testsuite with final grammar

N Grammar comparision
N.1 Testsuite
   N.1.1 Initial grammar
      XX/XXX positive items parsed (X% coverage)
      X/XX negative items parsed (X% overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         positive items that parsed had X parses.
         negative itmes that parsed had X parses
      
	{IGT}

   N.1.2 Final grammar
      XX/XXX positive items parsed (X% coverage)
      X/XX negative items parsed (X% overgeneration)
      
      On average:
         Positive items that parsed had X parses.
         Negative items that parsed had X parses.
      
      The most ambiguous items had X parses:

      	 {IGT}
