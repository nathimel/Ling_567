Lab 3 Write up
by David Krug and Nathaniel Imel

===================================================================================================

1. Initial and final [incr tsdb()] runs results for test corpus and test suite
	1.1.initial, corpus
		54 out of 54 parsed
		30 out of 32 negative items parsed (i.e. huge overgeneration)
	We believe this is caused by the fact we didn't really handle agreement yet. All we did
	was specify in the choices file the kinds of agreement categories  and added things like
	_1dl.incl_v_rel to the predications on the new lexical items (i.e. verb clitics as aux types).
	I verified this by checking in the feature structures for our parses, which didn't show the
	necessary PERNUM values. 

	1.1.2 average number of parses per parsed item: 1.73
	1.1.3 Most ambiguous example received: 7
	1.1.4 Ambiguity:

	    A major source is the fact that the clitics are being parsed as pronouns,
	    and the pronouns are being parsed as clitics. We didn't actually think
	    through our additions very carefully when specifying them in the customization
	    which means also that things which should be _pron_rels are _n_rels.
	1.2 initial, testsuite
		1.2.1 How many items parsed?
		1.2.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
		1.2.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
		1.2.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	1.3 final, corpus
		1.3.1 How many items parsed?
		1.3.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
		1.3.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
		1.3.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
	1.4 final, testsuite
		1.4.1 How many items parsed?
		1.4.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
		1.4.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
		1.4.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?

2. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in
the semantics? (Emily will demo in class on Tuesday.)

3. Documentation of the phenomena you have added to your testsuite
We added:
- the rest of the NP (determiners)
- coordination
- tense

	3.1 Determiners.
		Titan has two main types of demonstratives, the first (tita, titan,	tito, ilatu) can be
	either the prenominal determiner to an NP or the independent head of an NP. The second (ita,
	itan, ito, latu) can only be the postnominal modifer of an NP.
	
	Here are some examples:
	
	# Prenominal determiner
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: g
	Phenomena: {determiners}
	Tita manuai kip.
	this eagle lie
	This eagle lies.
	
	# Independent head
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: g
	Phenomena: {determiners}
	Tita kip.
	this lie
	This lies.
	
	# Postnominal modifier
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: g
	Phenomena: {determiners}
	Manuai ita kip.
	eagle this lie
	This eagle lies.
	
	# Wrong determiner in prenominal position	
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: u
	Phenomena: {determiners}
	Ita manuai kip.
	this eagle lie
	This eagle lies.
	
	
	3.2 Coordination
		Titan has polysyndetic coordination with two possible conjunctions, 'pe' (and) and 'ne'
	(or) that occur between each coordinated element. 'Pe' can conjoin two VPs or two NPs, but
	'ne' can only conjoin two NPs. If two singular NPs are coordinated, the resulting NP is dual.
	The entire paradigm from coordinand person and number to coordination person and number is
	not given in the descriptive resource. 
	
	Here are some examples.
	
	# Coordination of VPs
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: g
	Phenomena: {coordination}
	Yo o kip pe oi a kip.
	1sg 1sg.nfut lie and 2sg 2sg.nfut lie.
	'I lie and you lie.'
	
	# Coordination of subject NPs
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: g
	Phenomena: {coordination}
	Yo pe oi yoru kip.
	1sg and 2sg 1dl.incl lie.
	'I and you lie.'
	
	# Failed VP coordination using 'ne'
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: u
	Phenomena: {coordination}
	Yo o kip ne oi a kip.
	1sg 1sg.nfut lie or 2sg 2sg.nfut lie.
	'I lie or you lie.'
	'I lie and you lie.'
	
	# Wrong verbal clitic agreement
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: u
	Phenomena: {coordination}
	Yo pe oi yoya kip.
	1sg and 2sg 1pl lie.
	'I and you lie.'
	
	3.3 Tense
	Titan has two tenses: future and non-future. Future tense is marked by use of the irrealis verbal clitic, and non-future is marked with the realis clitic. The subject and irrealis clitic must agree in person.
	
	Here are some examples:
	
	# Future tense clitic agreement
	Source: author
	Vetted: f
	Judgment: g
	Phenomena: {tense, agreement}
	Yo ku kip
	1sg 1sg.fut lie
	'I will lie.'

4. Documentation of the improvements you made the morphotactic choices. What did you change and why?
Please include IGT that illustrate the effects of the changes so I can test them out
