1. Are cross-reference agreement clitics not required following determiner-noun phrases? E.g.
	
Tita nga         eyo    poen, tita rop    eyo poen
that lime.vessel lsg.ps not   that basket lsg.ps not
"That lime pot isn't mine, and that basket isn't mine!"

*******NB: I believe the above question to be answered by the lack of copula. 

2. Is there a different adnominal possessive suffix than "-i" for 3sg? We couldn't find it, or (yo)to(tulumo)
or yoya in our corpus.

*******NB: Yep, it's "-n"!

We found "Yo ulumui das alan, das i camar", but you also said in first and second
person the cross reference clitics always appear with an independent pronoun.

*******NB: this doesn't seem well-formed enough.

For the perfective markers, it seems they can appear with and without an independent
pronoun preceding them. I.e.

	oi kone kip
	2sg 2sg.perf lie
	You've lied!

	kone kip
	2sg.perf lie
	You've lied!

Would they mean the same thing?


We know that
	oi cinal
	2sg devil
	You are the devil

Can one say:
	cinal oi
	devil 2sg
	The devil is you

?
