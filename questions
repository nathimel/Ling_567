1. Are cross-reference agreement clitics not required following determiner-noun phrases? E.g.

	
Tita nga         eyo    poen, tita rop    eyo poen
that lime.vessel lsg.ps not   that basket lsg.ps not
"That lime pot isn't mine, and that basket isn't mine!"

2. Is there a different adnominal possessive suffix than "-i" for 3sg? We couldn't find it, or (yo)to(tulumo)
or yoya in our corpus.
