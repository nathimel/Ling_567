We found "Yo ulumui das alan, das i camar", but you also said in first and second
person the cross reference clitics always appear with an independent pronoun.

*******NB: this doesn't seem well-formed enough.

PRON/CLITIC AMBIGUITY

We're wondering about cases like the following:

         Ala        kip
         3pl.realis lie
         "They lied."
	 
"Ala" and the other cross-reference subject agreement markers have the same
form as their pronoun counterparts. So we're wondering: if there's only one
of the things that might be a pronoun or might be an agreement clitic in the
sentence, which is it? 

*******NB: didn't Emily say to just pick one analysis and go with it? But how
would we implement the grammar so that we rule one in and not the other?

      - To make just the clitic/aux grammatical, we could say that agreement
      clitics are obligatory. But this gets the wrong analysis for equative
      sentences, which don't have copulas.
      		 - We could say that any sentence that has a main verb,
		 must have an agreement clitic preceding that main verb.
		 That would take care of ruling out pronouns here and ruling
		 in agreement clitics and not ruling out equative sentences.
		 - this doesn't take care of adjective-like verbs in our
		 language, such as "muan"=be_bad

		 	   oi muan
			   2sg be_bad
			   "You're bad"
			   (NP VP)

For the perfective markers, it seems they can appear with and without an independent
pronoun preceding them. I.e.

	oi kone kip
	2sg 2sg.perf lie
	You've lied!

	kone kip
	2sg.perf lie
	You've lied!

Would they mean the same thing?
