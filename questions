1. Are cross-reference agreement clitics not required following determiner-noun phrases? E.g.

	
Tita nga         eyo    poen, tita rop    eyo poen
that lime.vessel lsg.ps not   that basket lsg.ps not
"That lime pot isn't mine, and that basket isn't mine!"

2. Is there a different adnominal possessive suffix than "-i" for 3sg? We couldn't find it, or (yo)to(tulumo)
or yoya in our corpus.

We found "Yo ulumui das alan, das i camar", but you also said in first and second
person the cross reference clitics always appear with an independent pronoun.


For the perfective markers, can they show up in realis or irrealis?
And can the perfective (i.e., kine) marker co-occur with the mood (realis=i, irrealis=ki) marker?
