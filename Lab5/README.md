	COORDINATION
	- Looks like 'ne' is only a verb, but it is a conjunction (='or')

	IRREALIS AGREEMENT
	- still can't make agreement work; but we can add the auxiliaries

	ADNOMINAL POSSESSION
	- Already implemented!

	-----Lab 4 stuff--

	WH- questions
	- I already know how to implement these, so I'll do as many as I can.
	NB: I had a hard time constructing simple enough test cases.

		-NB: Emily said to not include test cases where there are no
		verbs.

	CLAUSAL COMPLEMENTS
	- the verb 'va' (='say') is a great one to implement.

	ADVERBIAL MODIFIERS
	- the word 'alan' is relatively regular, but only shows up in irrealis.
	Not clear how to implement constraints on a verb to only show up with
	irrealis mood in the subordinate clause -- maybe ask Emily?

when we have full noun phrase subjects (nonpronominal) are the agreement clitics obligatory?
