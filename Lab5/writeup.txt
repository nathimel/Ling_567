Lab 5 Writeup
By David Krug and Nathaniel Imel

===============================================================================
1. We improved the choices file for five phenomena:
   - coordination
   - irrealis mood
   - clausal complements
   - adverbial clausal modifiers
   - wh question words
   The last 3 of these we wrote testsuite examples for last week.
   	
   1.1 Cordination
   	Phenomenon: Titan has only polysyntedic coordination. There are two
           coordinators: 'pe' ('or') and 'ne' ('or'). 'Ne' can coordinate NPs
           or VPs, 'pe' can coordinate only NPs. The coordinators appear before
           the coordinands.

   	snake 3sg.nfut create land and 3sg.create create food and 3sg.nfut create1pl.inc
   	The snake created the land, food, us.
   	
   	Our analysis: We removed all coordination strategies previously in the
           choices file and added two. The first covers 'pe' and allows NP or
           VP coordination. The second strategy covers 'ne' and allows only VP
           coordination.

   1.2 Irrealis mood
   	Phenomenon: There are four verbal agreement clitics that show irrealis
           mood as well as person and number: ku, ka, ku, __
   	
        <IGT>
        
        Our analysis: We addeded four auxiliary verb types and gave them
           restrictions on mood.

   1.3 Clausal complements
   	Phenomenon: There are some verbs in Titan that take clauses as a
           complement. Most of these do not make and specification about the
           mood of of the complement clause, except 'poa~pa' ('<???>'), which
           requires that its compelemtn clause be irrealis.

	<IGT of poa-pa>
        
   	Our analysis: We edited the page "clausal complements"
   	
   	<copy-paste choices file>

   1.4 Adverbial clausal modifiers
   	Phenomenon: Titan has adverbial modifies, like 'alan' ('if').
           <details about alan>
        
        <IGT of alan>

2. Translating the MMT sentences
   What are the translations?
   How did we get those translations?
   Are any sentences impossible to translate?

===============================================================================
3. Setting up machine translation
   What happened when we tried the MT set up?
   What difficulties did we encounter?	How did you resolve them?
   What output did we get?

===============================================================================
4. Grammar performance comparison
   4.1. Initial grammar with testsuite (copied from Lab 4)
   	43/82 positive items parse (52.4% coverage)
   	30/72 negative itmes parse (41.7% overgeneration)
   	
   	On average, parsed items had 1.28 parses.
   		
   	Most ambiguous run: Same as initial run, the most ambiguous sentence
   		was "Ala kip" which got 3 parses. From the new test suite
   		sentences, the most ambiguous sentence was "Yoru ki kip" which
   		got two parses. This was ambiguous because "yoru" was getting
   		parsed as a pronoun and a verbal clitic.
   		
   	Sources of ambiguity: Same as initial run, verbal clitics and and
   		pronouns get confused.
   	
   4.2 Initial grammar with corpus (same as Lab 3)
       		1.2.1 How many items parsed?
   		      24 out of 563 positive items (4.3%)
   		      
   	4.2.2 What is the average number of parses per parsed item? 1.50
   	4.2.3 How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
   	      There were two sentences that received 3 trees:
   	      
   	      'Ala iri i.' and 'Ara vavuen.'
   	      
   	4.2.4 What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
   	
   	      Mostly the pronoun/clitic confusion.

   4.4 Final grammar with corpus (n/a)
