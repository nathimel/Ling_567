Lab 5 Writeup
By David Krug and Nathaniel Imel

Notes/questions:
   Should we remove things like:
      noun1_stem169 (orth=ki)
      noun1_stem47 (orth=ca, pred=_what_n_rel)
   Are there duplicate auxs?
      aux39_stem1_orth=ku
      aux40_stem1_orth=ku (should this be 'ko'?)
   nfut/fut vs real/irr
   Do we need to be as deltailed in the prose description of phenomena as we
      were last week? 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 are mostly identical to Lab4.
   Should question pronouns have an optional determiner?

1. We improved the choices file for five phenomena:
   - coordination
   - irrealis mood
   - clausal complements
   - adverbial clausal modifiers
   - wh question words
   The last 3 of these we wrote testsuite examples for last week.
      
   1.1 Cordination
      Phenomenon: Titan has only polysyntedic coordination. There are two
           coordinators: 'pe' ('or') and 'ne' ('or'). 'Ne' can coordinate NPs
           or VPs, 'pe' can coordinate only NPs. The coordinators appear before
           the coordinands.
      
      Moat  i        tawi   kor, pe  i        tawi   kan  pe  i        tawi   yota
      snake 3sg.nfut create land and 3sg.nfut create food and 3sg.nfut create 1pl.inc
      The snake created the land, food, and us.
      
      <ungrammatical IGT?>
      
      Our analysis: We removed all coordination strategies previously in the
           choices file and added two. The first covers 'pe' and allows NP or
           VP coordination. The second strategy covers 'ne' and allows only VP
           coordination.
      
      Choices file:
      section=coordination
        cs1_np=on
        cs1_vp=on
        cs1_pat=poly
        cs1_mark=word
        cs1_orth=pe
        cs1_order=before
        cs2_np=on
        cs2_pat=poly
        cs2_mark=word
        cs2_orth=ne
        cs2_order=before
   
   1.2 Irrealis mood
      Phenomenon: There are four verbal agreement clitics that mark irrealis
         mood as well as agree for person and number: ku, ko, ki, ka

      Our analysis: We addeded four auxiliary verb types and gave them
         restrictions on mood. We haven't gotten person and number working yet.
      
      Choices file: <copy-paste lines 2571-2603 from choices file>
   
   1.3 Clausal complements
      Phenomenon: There are some verbs in Titan that take clauses as a
           complement. Most of these do not make any specification about the
           mood of of the complement clause, except 'pa~poa' ('<???>'), which
           requires that its compelement clause be irrealis.
        
      # 'va' taking a clausal comp with realis mood
      Ato va  Oi  a        kip
      3pc say 2sg 2sg.nfut kip
      They said, "You're lying!".
      
      # 'va' taking a clausal comp with irrealis mood
      
      # 'pa~poa' requires irrealis
      Yo  pa   ku      le    Yap
      1sg want 1sg.fut go.to Yap
      I want to go to Yap.
     
      <ungrammatical IGT>
      
      Our analysis: We edited the page Clausal Complements and added two
         clausal complement stratgies. The first covers most verbs that
         take a clausal complement, and it does not restrict the value of mood.
         The second strategy covers verbs like 'pa~poa' and constrains the mood
         value of the clausal comlement.
      
      Choices file:
      section=clausal-comp
        cmops1_clause-pos-same=on
        cmops1_ques=prop
        cmops2_clause-pos-same=on
        cmops2_ques=prop
          comps2_feat1_name=mood
          comps2_feat2_value=irr

   1.4 Adverbial clausal modifiers
      Phenomenon: Titan has adverbial modifies, like 'alan' ('if/before'),
         which take the form of a free subordination morpheme that occurs
         before the matrix clause and attaches to/modifies sentences. The
         meaning of 'alan' depends on the mood of the <subordinate|matrix>
         clause.

      Our analysis: We added two Clausal Modifier strategies to cover the two
         different uses of 'alan'. The first strategie __

   1.5 Wh question words
      Phenomenon: Titan has several interrogative pronouns that occur in situ.
        
      # 'ca' in situ.

      what 2sg 2sg.nfut eat
      What are you eating?
        
      Our analysis: We added several nouns types and made them each questions
         pronouns. Each question pronoun has an optional determiner, and no
         morphotactic constraints.

2. Translating the MMT sentences
   What are the translations?
   How did we get those translations?
   Are any sentences impossible to translate?

3. Setting up machine translation
   What happened when we tried the MT set up?
   What difficulties did we encounter?   How did you resolve them?
   What output did we get?

4. Grammar performance comparison
   4.1. Initial grammar with testsuite (copied from Lab 4)
      43/82 positive items parse (52.4% coverage)
      30/72 negative itmes parse (41.7% overgeneration)
      
      On average, parsed items had 1.28 parses.
      	
      Most ambiguous item: Same as initial run, the most ambiguous sentence
      	was "Ala kip" which got 3 parses. From the new test suite
      	sentences, the most ambiguous sentence was "Yoru ki kip" which
      	got two parses. This was ambiguous because "yoru" was getting
      	parsed as a pronoun and a verbal clitic.
      	
      Sources of ambiguity: Same as initial run, verbal clitics and and
      	pronouns get confused.
      
   4.2 Initial grammar with corpus (copied from Lab 4)
      24/563 positive items (4.3% coverage)
      	      
      On average, parsed items had 1.50 parses.
      
      Most ambiguous item:
         There were two sentences that received 3 trees:
         'Ala iri i.' and 'Ara vavuen.'
            
      Sources of ambiguity:
         Mostly the pronoun/clitic confusion.
