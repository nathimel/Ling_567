Lab 5 Writeup
By David Krug and Nathaniel Imel

Notes/questions:
   1.6.2
   There are duplicates ku's, missing ko
      aux39_stem1_orth=ku
      aux40_stem1_orth=ku (this should be 'ko')
   nfut/fut vs real/irr
   Do we need to be as deltailed in the prose description of phenomena as we
      were last week? 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 are mostly identical to Lab4.
   Should question pronouns have an optional determiner?

===============================================================================
1. We improved the choices file for five phenomena:
   - coordination
   - irrealis mood
   - clausal complements
   - adverbial clausal modifiers
   - wh question words
   The last 3 of these we wrote testsuite examples for last week.
      
   1.1 Cordination
      Phenomenon: Titan has only polysyntedic coordination. There are two
           coordinators: 'pe' ('or') and 'ne' ('or'). 'Ne' can coordinate NPs
           or VPs, 'pe' can coordinate only NPs. The coordinators appear before
           the coordinands.
      
      # Polysyndeton coordination
      Moat  i        tawi   kor pe  i        tawi   kan  pe  i        tawi   yota
      snake 3sg.nfut create land and 3sg.nfut create food and 3sg.nfut create 1pl.inc
      The snake created the land, food, and us.
      
      # Titan does not have monosyndeton coordination
      *Moat  i        tawi   kor  i        tawi   kan  pe  i        tawi   yota
      snake 3sg.nfut create land 3sg.nfut create food and 3sg.nfut create 1pl.inc
      The snake created the land, food, and us.
      
      Our analysis: We removed all coordination strategies previously in the
           choices file and added two. The first covers 'pe' and allows NP or
           VP coordination. The second strategy covers 'ne' and allows only VP
           coordination.
      
      Choices file:
      section=coordination
        cs1_np=on
        cs1_vp=on
        cs1_pat=poly
        cs1_mark=word
        cs1_orth=pe
        cs1_order=before
        cs2_np=on
        cs2_pat=poly
        cs2_mark=word
        cs2_orth=ne
        cs2_order=before
   
   1.2 Irrealis mood
      Phenomenon: There are four verbal agreement clitics that mark irrealis
         mood as well as agree for person and number: ku, ko, ki, ka
      
      # Agreement between 'Taru' and 'ka'

      Phenomena: {tense, modals}
      I   ku      kip
      3sg 1sg.fut lie
        
      Our analysis: We addeded four auxiliary verb types and gave them
         restrictions on mood. We haven't gotten person and number working yet.
      
      Choices file: <copy-paste lines 2571-2603 from choices file>
   
   1.3 Clausal complements
      Phenomenon: There are some verbs in Titan that take clauses as a
         complement. Most of these do not make any specification about the
         mood of of the complement clause, except 'pa~poa' ('want'), which
         requires that its compelement clause be irrealis.
      If a verb takes a clausal complement in either mood, the mood can
         affect the meaning of the verb.
        
      # 'va' taking a clausal comp with realis mood
      Ato va  Oi  a        kip
      3pc say 2sg 2sg.nfut kip
      They said, "You're lying!".
      
      # 'va' taking a clausal comp with irrealis mood
      I va ki puti yo
      3sg want 2sg.fut marry 2sg
      He wants to marry me.
      
      # 'pa~poa' requires irrealis
      Yo  pa   ku      le    Yap
      1sg want 1sg.fut go.to Yap
      I want to go to Yap.
     
      # 'va' can not take only an NP
      Ato va yoito
      3pc said 1pc.excl.
      They said, "We".
      
      Our analysis: We edited the page Clausal Complements and added two
         clausal complement stratgies. The first covers most verbs that
         take a clausal complement, and it does not restrict the value of mood.
         The second strategy covers verbs like 'pa~poa' and constrains the mood
         value of the clausal comlement.

      section=clausal-comp
        cmops1_clause-pos-same=on
        cmops1_ques=prop
        cmops2_clause-pos-same=on
        cmops2_ques=prop
          comps2_feat1_name=mood
          comps2_feat2_value=irr

   1.4 Adverbial clausal modifiers
      Phenomenon: Titan has adverbial modifies, like 'alan' ('if/before'),
         which take the form of a free subordination morpheme that occurs
         before the matrix clause and attaches to/modifies sentences. The
         meaning of 'alan' depends on the mood of the <subordinate|matrix>
         clause.
        
      # 'alan' irrealis marks conditional

      Vetted: f
      Judgement: g
      Oi  ko      kip alan yo  ku      kip
      2sg 2sg.fut lie if   1sg 1sg.fut lie
      If you lie, I will lie.
      
      # 'alan' with realis marks causitive
      Source: author
      Vetted: f
      Judgement: g
      Yo ulumui das alan, das i camar.
      1sg drink sea because sea 3sg dry.up
      Because I drank the sea, the sea water has dried up.
      
      # 'alan' can not appear after the matrix clause
      Oi ko kip yo ku kip alan.
      2sg 2sg.fut lie 2sg 2sg.fut lie if.
      You will lie if I will lie.
      
      Our analysis: We added two Clausal Modifier strategies to cover the two
         different uses of 'alan'. The first strategy __

          cms2_feat1_name=mood
          cms2_feat1_value=realis

   1.5 Wh question words
      Phenomenon: Titan has several interrogative pronouns that occur in situ.
        
      # 'ca' in situ.

      Vetted: f
      Judgment:g

      Ca   oi  a        ani
      what 2sg 2sg.nfut eat
      What are you eating?
        
      Our analysis: We added several nouns types and made them each questions
         pronouns. Each question pronoun has an optional determiner, and no
         morphotactic constraints.

   1.6 Miscellaneous choices changes
      There were a few minor cleanup changes that we made to the choices file.
      
      1.6.1 Removed Case
         The initial choices file from the start of Lab 2 included case, which
            which Titan does not have. We removed case, which made a bunch of
            errros.
      
      1.6.2 Removed old lexical entries.
         The auto-inference system picked up:
            noun1_stem169 (orth=ki)
            noun1_stem47 (orth=ca, pred=_what_n_rel)

===============================================================================
2. Translating the MMT sentences
   Of the 26 sentences in eng.txt, we translated 18 of them. Of the 8 we
      skipped, 3 of them we determined to be impossiblee to translate.
   
   2.1 Example translations
      Here are the first three sentences we translated:
      
      Muiny ala      metir.
      dog   3pl.nfut sleep
      Dogs sleep.
      
      Muiny ala      voliliti dilen.
      dog   3pl.nfut follow   canoe
      Dogs follow canoes.
      
      Yo  u        voliliti oi.
      1sg 1sg.nfut follow   you.
      I follow you.
   
   2.2 Mis-translatated words
      Three of the English words in eng.txt do not have Titan translations, so
         we replaced those words with semantically similar words as follows:
      chase - follow (voliliti)
      cat   - osprey (manuai)
      car   - canoe (dilen)
   
   2.3 Impossible translations
      The three sentences we found to be impossible to translate were the three
         sentences with the word 'ask'. In Titan, the word for ask is 'va',
         which requires that there be a vocative or adressee of the question.
   
      Therefore, "I asked what the dogs chased" is not translatable, but
         "I asked 'John, what did the dogs chase?'" is translatable.
   
   2.4 Other skipped translations
      Of the five sentences that we skipped but that aren't impossible to
         translate, three of them have words which we have no translation
         for: 'think', 'know', and 'after'.
      The other two that we skipped have phenomena that we haven't yet
         implemented: prepositions and yes/no questions.

===============================================================================
3. Setting up machine translation
   What happened when we tried the MT set up?
   3.1 What difficulties did we encounter? How did you resolve them?
   3.2 What output did we get?

===============================================================================
4. Grammar performance comparison
   4.1. Initial grammar with testsuite (copied from Lab 4)
      43/82 positive items parse (52.4% coverage)
      30/72 negative itmes parse (41.7% overgeneration)
      
      On average, parsed items had 1.28 parses.
      	
      Most ambiguous item: Same as initial run, the most ambiguous sentence
      	was "Ala kip" which got 3 parses. From the new test suite
      	sentences, the most ambiguous sentence was "Yoru ki kip" which
      	got two parses. This was ambiguous because "yoru" was getting
      	parsed as a pronoun and a verbal clitic.
      	
      Sources of ambiguity: Same as initial run, verbal clitics and and
      	pronouns get confused.
      
   4.2 Initial grammar with corpus (copied from Lab 4)
      24/563 positive items (4.3% coverage)
      	      
      On average, parsed items had 1.50 parses.
      
      Most ambiguous item:
         There were two sentences that received 3 trees:
         'Ala iri i.' and 'Ara vavuen.'
            
      Sources of ambiguity:
         Mostly the pronoun/clitic confusion.
