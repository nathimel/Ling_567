Lab 5 Writeup
By David Krug and Nathaniel Imel

===============================================================================
1. A description of the changes you made to your semi.vpm file, why you made
those specifc changes, and how that affected generator output.

      We will make the following trivial changes:
      	 PER, NUM, and GEND all have the PNG. value on the rhs, which Emily says to delete
	 TENSE, ASPECT, and MOOD all have the E. value on the rhs, which Emily says to delete.
	 	- we probably want to write "no-aspect" as a default aspect


===============================================================================
2. A description of the phenomena you improved in the grammar (including both
the morphology etc clean up and adnominal possession or clausal complements),
including:

 CLEANUP of CONSTRAINTS
**************

We'll probably remove morphology that's insufficiently constrained or adding constraints to that morph.

      MORPH we're seeing:

(For ttv to ttv)
      For "dogs sleep" we got about a page, about half for eng to ttv
      For "dogs follow canoes", we got about a page of sentences. (unknown sem index)
      For "I follow you" I had to kill the process. My guess is thousands, and
      idk if it would have stopped. (unknown sem index)
      

      ************************************************
      -n and -m suffixes on the end of 'dog' and 'canoe'
      - the word ka is empty here
      	    	 ***NB: there is only one 'ka,' unlike the other clitics.
		 	** getting a lot of sentences with the other irr clitics,
			so cleaning up that is a priority.
			
      	     e.g., " Muiny-n ala ka voliliti dilen-m"


	   **What -n and -m do:**
	   	  - In our choices file, they're the first two noun_pcs, and their
		  lexical rule types have no features/values.

		  -n seems to be for adnominal possession, marking on the possessum
		  the agreement of the possessor. Here's some IGT:

		      Po Ma aru dasi   -n   aru va    ka      le    leq
		      P.M.  3dl brother-3sg 3dl think nsg.fut go_to shore 
		      Po Ma and his brother wanted to go to the shore.


		   -m seems to be for adnominal possession too, but for 2sg:

		      yo  u       tawi  pel       ile  poa  -m
		      1sg 1sg.fut place taro_pulp into mouth-2sg.poss
		      I will put taro pulp in your mouth.

		   -These glosses are consistent with the discussion of inalienable
		   possession suffixation, which also says that -o means 1sg.poss,
		   though that doesn't seem to be in our choices file. Also, it only
		   applies as suffixation when the stem ends in the vowel "a".

		   Our plan is to improve the Adnominal Possession phenomena for
		   inalienable possession markers -o, -m, -n.

      -List of other SEMANTICALLY EMPTY WORD candidates:
      
      	    k' --- one sem. empty aux 27
	    aqani -- " aux_28
	    poro --- noun1_stem369 w/ pred, " aux_22
	    kine -- verb1_stem89 w/ pred (looks spurious), " aux_9
	    porokiny -- " aux_22
	    keiny --- noun_50 (pron_n_rel), " aux_19
	    
     	    k' seems like an alternation of any irrealis clitic, as the descriptive
	    resources has it glossed for 3sg.fut and 1pl.fut. But it only
	    occurs in the test corpus once, as "fut", though it looks like from the
	    context it should have 1sg agreement.

	    aqani is glossed as "present.with.gifts" or "support". The Titan-English
	    dictionary in our resources has the following entry:

	    	       NB: what does Lusk mean?

	    	       aijani v.tr 1. present with gifts, present, offer
		       2. support, look after
		       Lusk: agani 'feed


            poro is glossed as a hole.
	    porokiny means pot
	    T-E Dictionary entry:

	    	
		poro n.ia hole.
		porokiny n
		1. pot
		2. wooden bowl.
		Lusk: porokin.


	    kine is a 3sg perfective marker, part of the set kune, kone, kine, and kane
	    which correspond to their similar irrealis verb clitic markers.
	    
	    Keiny is glossed as "pot", and is a synonym with porokiny
	    in the English-Titan glossary.

	    

With semantically empty words, we'll add more constraints and might refine trigger rules.



"""
preliminary notes/TODO list on 'va'/'pa'

   1.  We'll probably write another lex. entry for 'va' to mean 'think_v_rel'.
    	  - see canvas; 'pa' often glossed as 'thought to do y'
   2. Remove the spurious 'va' auto-inferred that has a long predication
   3. For 'Pa~Poa':
      - the 'poa' form allows non-second, but it shouldn't
      - for some reason there are four extra lex entries for 'ku'
      	    - ku_3 is correct and means 1sg.fut, spec for irrealis
	    -ku_1 means 3rd (underspec for num) but is spec for irrealis? and is a NOUN
	    -ku_2 means 1sg but is a PRONOUN, but is spec for irrealis?
	    -ku_4 and ku_5 are just underspecified for num and per, but is spec for irrealis

	    EVERYTHING except ku_3 need to be deleted. I think the reason the verb is spec
	    for irrealis is actually a result of 'pa' requiring an irrealis complement,
	    not a result of the agreement clitics/ the nominal entries.
	    	- though I checked 'Yo ku kip', and that had ku_3, ku_5, and ku_4, and the
		head verb 'kip' was specified for irr for all three.
		     - note for 'Taru ka kip' the person was 3 and unspecified for number
		       	    -furthermore while 'ka' has only one entry, the mood is spec
			    as 'realis', and the per, num are unspecified. Both are wrong.
		     - note that 'Manuai ki kip' has per=3 num-unspec, and mood=unspec (and tense=unspec)
		     - note that 'Oi ko kip' has only one tree, but ko_2 and it means "2sg.fut-or-fall_v_rel
		       	    -i.e. this is an auto-inferred lex entry, should delete it.
	-UPSHOT for the AGR clitics seems to be:
		- delete all but the correct entry;
		- make the entry specify for per, num

3. A description of the performance of your final grammar for this week on the
test suite and test corpus, as compared to your starting grammar (see details above).


     3.1.1 Final testsuite with initial grammar for the week
     3.1.2 Final testsuite with final grammar for the week
     3.2.1 Test corpus with initial grammar for the week
     
      - On average, parsed items had 2.89 parses.

      - Most ambiguous item:
	The most ambiguous items had 10 and 15 parses.

	  The sentence with 15 parses is:

	     ala va  yota    ka   mulie
	     3pl say 1pl.inc hort turn
	     'They said let s turn around'

	  10 parses:

	      i va awa ka la
	      3sg say 2pl hort go
      	     'He said you go.'

	      ato va i kine me
	      3pl say 3sg 3sg.perf come
	      'They said he s come.'

       These sentences are using the complement embedding verb 'va' and the irrealis verb clitic 'ka.' We know there
       are two entries for 'va'. There only seems to be one entry for 'ka', though. My guess is that there's lots
       of structural ambiguity in how the VP trees are constructed.
