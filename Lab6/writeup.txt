Lab 5 Writeup
By David Krug and Nathaniel Imel


Qs for Emily:

Differences between MT grammar and our Lab6 directory grammar. Once we have an
updated grammar, is it fine to just copy that new grammar into the MT directory
to replace the old one? Because we remember there were like 10 steps to complete
to go from having a grammar to using it for MT.

Go over comments for last lab, especially:
   what did you mean by:

  " You'll need to add entries for dog and car (well, dog and canoe) with the
   PRED values _dog_n_rel and _car_n_rel."
   	- in the grammar? We already have _dog_n_rel. What about _chase_v_rel?

Is it enough that we are basically improving on our improvements from last lab (adposs, CC)

===============================================================================
1. A description of the changes you made to your semi.vpm file, why you made
those specifc changes, and how that affected generator output.

      We made the following changes:
      	 PER, NUM, and GEND all have the PNG. value on the rhs, which Emily says to delete
	 TENSE, ASPECT, and MOOD all have the E. value on the rhs, which Emily says to delete.
	 	- we probably want to write "no-aspect" as a default aspect?
	 Spelling out the abbreviated left-hand side values on the right hand side

	 We are considering deleting the entire TENSE property, because we've been
	 implementing the tense marker as just an irrealis marker. All of our examples
	 of the irrealis markers have in fact been for future sentences, and in our
	 test cases, we've given glosses like:
	 
	    Manuai ki kip
	    eagle  3sg.fut lie
	    'The eagle will lie.'

	 But now maybe we should gloss as 3sg.irr

	 But then we'll need
	 a transfer rule to map future tense to our irrealis mood?

===============================================================================
2. A description of the phenomena you improved in the grammar (including both
the morphology etc clean up and adnominal possession or clausal complements),
including:

 CLEANUP of CONSTRAINTS
**************

From lab5 comments
**************
We will say that auxiliaries take only VP complements instead of V, so as to reduce the ambiguity about
where the object drops wrt to the aux.

We need to answer the questions on the wh questions page and then specify that your wh pronouns are actually wh pronouns.

We should fix 'matir'=sleep to be intransitive, rather than transitive.
****************

We'll probably remove morphology that's insufficiently constrained or adding constraints to that morph.

      MORPH we're seeing:

(For ttv to ttv)
      For "dogs sleep" we got about a page, about half for eng to ttv
      For "dogs follow canoes", we got about a page of sentences. (unknown sem index)
      For "I follow you", "
      

      ************************************************
      -n and -m suffixes on the end of 'dog' and 'canoe'
      - the word ka is empty here
      	    	 ***NB: there is only one 'ka,' unlike the other clitics.
		 	** getting a lot of sentences with the other irr clitics,
			so cleaning up that is a priority.
			
      	     e.g., " Muiny-n ala ka voliliti dilen-m"


	   **What -n and -m do:**
	   	  - In our choices file, they're the first two noun_pcs, and their
		  lexical rule types have no features/values.

		  -n seems to be for adnominal possession, marking on the possessum
		  the agreement of the possessor. Here's some IGT:

		      Po Ma aru dasi   -n   aru va    ka      le    leq
		      P.M.  3dl brother-3sg 3dl think nsg.fut go_to shore 
		      Po Ma and his brother wanted to go to the shore.


		   -m seems to be for adnominal possession too, but for 2sg:

		      yo  u       tawi  pel       ile  poa  -m
		      1sg 1sg.fut place taro_pulp into mouth-2sg.poss
		      I will put taro pulp in your mouth.

		   -These glosses are consistent with the discussion of inalienable
		   possession suffixation, which also says that -o means 1sg.poss,
		   though that doesn't seem to be in our choices file. Also, it only
		   applies as suffixation when the stem ends in the vowel "a".

		   Our plan is to improve the Adnominal Possession phenomena for
		   inalienable possession markers -o, -m, -n.

      -List of other SEMANTICALLY EMPTY WORD candidates:
      
      	    k' --- one sem. empty aux 27
	    aqani -- " aux_28
	    poro --- noun1_stem369 w/ pred, " aux_22
	    kine -- verb1_stem89 w/ pred (looks spurious), " aux_9
	    	 **EXPLORE the other perf markers?
	    porokiny -- " aux_22
	    keiny --- noun_50 (pron_n_rel), " aux_19
	    
     	    k' seems like an alternation of any irrealis clitic, as the descriptive
	    resources has it glossed for 3sg.fut and 1pl.fut. But it only
	    occurs in the test corpus once, as "fut", though it looks like from the
	    context it should have 1sg agreement.

	    aqani is glossed as "present.with.gifts" or "support". The Titan-English
	    dictionary in our resources has the following entry:

	    	       NB: what does Lusk mean?

	    	       aijani v.tr 1. present with gifts, present, offer
		       2. support, look after
		       Lusk: agani 'feed


            poro is glossed as a hole.
	    porokiny means pot
	    T-E Dictionary entry:

	    	
		poro n.ia hole.
		porokiny n
		1. pot
		2. wooden bowl.
		Lusk: porokin.


	    kine is a 3sg perfective marker, part of the set kune, kone, kine, and kane
	    which correspond to their similar irrealis verb clitic markers.
	    
	    Keiny is glossed as "pot", and is a synonym with porokiny
	    in the English-Titan glossary.

	    

With semantically empty words, we'll add more constraints and might refine trigger rules.



"""
preliminary notes/TODO list on 'va'/'pa'

   1.  We'll probably write another lex. entry for 'va' to mean 'think_v_rel'.
    	  - see canvas; 'pa' often glossed as 'thought to do y'
   2. Remove the spurious 'va' auto-inferred that has a long predication
   3. For 'Pa~Poa':
      - the 'poa' form allows non-second, but it shouldn't
      - for some reason there are four extra lex entries for 'ku'
      	    - ku_3 is correct and means 1sg.fut, spec for irrealis
	    -ku_1 means 3rd (underspec for num) but is spec for irrealis? and is a NOUN
	    -ku_2 means 1sg but is a PRONOUN, but is spec for irrealis?
	    -ku_4 and ku_5 are just underspecified for num and per, but is spec for irrealis

	    EVERYTHING except ku_3 need to be deleted. I think the reason the verb is spec
	    for irrealis is actually a result of 'pa' requiring an irrealis complement,
	    not a result of the agreement clitics/ the nominal entries.
	    	- though I checked 'Yo ku kip', and that had ku_3, ku_5, and ku_4, and the
		head verb 'kip' was specified for irr for all three.
		     - note for 'Taru ka kip' the person was 3 and unspecified for number
		       	    -furthermore while 'ka' has only one entry, the mood is spec
			    as 'realis', and the per, num are unspecified. Both are wrong.
		     - note that 'Manuai ki kip' has per=3 num-unspec, and mood=unspec (and tense=unspec)
		     - note that 'Oi ko kip' has only one tree, but ko_2 and it means "2sg.fut-or-fall_v_rel
		       	    -i.e. this is an auto-inferred lex entry, should delete it.
	-UPSHOT for the AGR clitics seems to be:
		- delete all but the correct entry;
		- make the entry specify for per, num

3. A description of the performance of your final grammar for this week on the
test suite and test corpus, as compared to your starting grammar (see details above).

     3.1.1 Final testsuite with initial grammar for the week
     3.1.2 Final testsuite with final grammar for the week
     3.2.1 Test corpus with initial grammar for the week
     
      - On average, parsed items had 2.89 parses.

      - Most ambiguous item:
	The most ambiguous items had 10 and 15 parses.

	  The sentence with 15 parses is:

	     ala va  yota    ka   mulie
	     3pl say 1pl.inc hort turn
	     'They said let s turn around'

	  10 parses:

	      i va awa ka la
	      3sg say 2pl hort go
      	     'He said you go.'

	      ato va i kine me
	      3pl say 3sg 3sg.perf come
	      'They said he s come.'

       These sentences are using the complement embedding verb 'va' and the irrealis verb clitic 'ka.' We know there
       are two entries for 'va'. There only seems to be one entry for 'ka', though. My guess is that there's lots
       of structural ambiguity in how the VP trees are constructed.
