1. A description of the changes you made to your semi.vpm file, why you made
those specifc changes, and how that affected generator output.
===============================================================================
2. A description of the phenomena you improved in the grammar (including both
the morphology etc clean up and adnominal possession or clausal complements),
including:

preliminary notes/TODO list on 'va'/'pa'

   1.  We'll probably write another lex. entry for 'va' to mean 'think_v_rel'.
    	  - see canvas; 'pa' often glossed as 'thought to do y'
   2. Remove the spurious 'va' auto-inferred that has a long predication
   3. For 'Pa~Poa':
      - the 'poa' form allows non-second, but it shouldn't
      - for some reason there are four extra lex entries for 'ku'
      	    - ku_3 is correct and means 1sg.fut, spec for irrealis
	    -ku_1 means 3rd (underspec for num) but is spec for irrealis? and is a NOUN
	    -ku_2 means 1sg but is a PRONOUN, but is spec for irrealis?
	    -ku_4 and ku_5 are just underspecified for num and per, but is spec for irrealis

	    EVERYTHING except ku_3 need to be deleted. I think the reason the verb is spec
	    for irrealis is actually a result of 'pa' requiring an irrealis complement,
	    not a result of the agreement clitics/ the nominal entries.
	    	- though I checked 'Yo ku kip', and that had ku_3, ku_5, and ku_4, and the
		head verb 'kip' was specified for irr for all three.
		     - note for 'Taru ka kip' the person was 3 and unspecified for number
		       	    -furthermore while 'ka' has only one entry, the mood is spec
			    as 'realis', and the per, num are unspecified. Both are wrong.
		     - note that 'Manuai ki kip' has per=3 num-unspec, and mood=unspec (and tense=unspec)
		     - note that 'Oi ko kip' has only one tree, but ko_2 and it means "2sg.fut-or-fall_v_rel
		       	    -i.e. this is an auto-inferred lex entry, should delete it.
	-UPSHOT for the AGR clitics seems to be:
		- delete all but the correct entry;
		- make the entry specify for per, num

   - Prose description of the phenomenon
    
   - Prose description of your analysis
    
   - The specific changes you made to the tdl (paste in the actual tdl)
    
   - Specific IGT I can use to test the analysis / investigate if something isn't
    working and you need help.

3. A description of the performance of your final grammar for this week on the
test suite and test corpus, as compared to your starting grammar (see details above).


     3.1.1 Final testsuite with initial grammar for the week
     3.1.2 Final testsuite with final grammar for the week
     3.2.1 Test corpus with initial grammar for the week
     
      - On average, parsed items had 2.89 parses.

      - Most ambiguous item:
	The most ambiguous items had 10 and 15 parses.

	  The sentence with 15 parses is:

	     ala va  yota    ka   mulie
	     3pl say 1pl.inc hort turn
	     'They said let s turn around'

	  10 parses:

	      i va awa ka la
	      3sg say 2pl hort go
      	     'He said you go.'

	      ato va i kine me
	      3pl say 3sg 3sg.perf come
	      'They said he s come.'

       These sentences are using the complement embedding verb 'va' and the irrealis verb clitic 'ka.' We know there
       are two entries for 'va'. There only seems to be one entry for 'ka', though. My guess is that there's lots
       of structural ambiguity in how the VP trees are constructed.
