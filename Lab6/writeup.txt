Lab 5 Writeup
By Nathaniel Imel and David Krug


Qs for Emily:

Why are we gettig 'ka' in Muiny ka matir
Why are we getting 'Muiny matir', and should we care?
Explain ASPECT in ttv.tdl

Go over comments for last lab, especially:
   what did you mean by:

  " You'll need to add entries for dog and car (well, dog and canoe) with the
   PRED values _dog_n_rel and _car_n_rel."
   	- sic., should be _chase_v_rel and _car_n_rel

===============================================================================
REMAINING TODO:

Work on VPM, i.e., maybe look in the D.R. for ASPECT?

===============================================================================
1. A description of the changes you made to your semi.vpm file, why you made
those specifc changes, and how that affected generator output.

      We made the following changes:

      	 Deleted E. on the right side of TENSE, ASPECT, and MOOD
	 Deleted PNG. on the right side of PER, NUM, and GEND
	 Spelled out 3rd as third, 2nd as second, 1st as first on the right side of PER
	 Spelled out nfut as non-future, fut as future, and pres as present on the right side of TENSE

===============================================================================
2. A description of the phenomena you improved in the grammar (including both
the morphology etc clean up and adnominal possession or clausal complements),
including:

 CLEANUP of CONSTRAINTS
**************

From lab5 comments
**************
We will say that auxiliaries take only VP complements instead of V, so as to reduce the ambiguity about
where the object drops wrt to the aux.

We need to answer the questions on the wh questions page and then specify that your wh pronouns are actually wh pronouns.

We should fix 'matir'=sleep to be intransitive, rather than transitive.

   	  delted:

	      verb1_stem119_orth=matir~

	    and also I accidentally spelled aux_40 as 'ku' instead of 'ko,'
	    so I fixed that orthography.

	            verb1_stem91_orth=ko~
   		    verb1_stem91_pred=_2sg.fut-or-2sg.pot-or-cfact-or-imp_v_rel

		       There is an intransitive 'ko,' but not the following transitive w/ the
		       union predication:

			       verb2_stem46_orth=ko
			       verb2_stem46_pred=_2sg.fut-or-fall_v_rel

		       So we deleted the above and added the correct one.

		       And aux_1 is spurious, so we deleted it:

             Here was a spurious determiner entry for "a" that's not

	    Here come the realis agr clitics.
	    The following needed to be tweaked, as tense should not be future, mood
	    should not be imp, etc. To make our analysis simpler and more consistent,
	    we're removing TENSE as a feature, even though n.fut is consistent with
	    IGT glosses.
	    So we are just analyzing agr clitic markers as realis/ irrealis.

		       yet in person/num yet for our grammar, so we didn't bother
		       to create the auxiliary.

****************

We'll probably remove morphology that's insufficiently constrained or adding constraints to that morph.

      MORPH we're seeing:

(For ttv to ttv)
      For "dogs sleep" we got about a page, about half for eng to ttv
      For "dogs follow canoes", we got about a page of sentences. (unknown sem index)
      For "I follow you", "
      

      ************************************************
      -n and -m suffixes on the end of 'dog' and 'canoe'
      - the word ka is empty here
      	    	 ***NB: there is only one 'ka,' unlike the other clitics.
		 	** getting a lot of sentences with the other irr clitics,
			so cleaning up that is a priority.
			
      	     e.g., " Muiny-n ala ka voliliti dilen-m"


	   **What -n and -m do:**
	   	  - In our choices file, they're the first two noun_pcs, and their
		  lexical rule types have no features/values.

		  -n seems to be for adnominal possession, marking on the possessum
		  the agreement of the possessor. Here's some IGT:

		      Po Ma aru dasi   -n   aru va    ka      le    leq
		      P.M.  3dl brother-3sg 3dl think nsg.fut go_to shore 
		      Po Ma and his brother wanted to go to the shore.


		   -m seems to be for adnominal possession too, but for 2sg:

		      yo  u       tawi  pel       ile  poa  -m
		      1sg 1sg.fut place taro_pulp into mouth-2sg.poss
		      I will put taro pulp in your mouth.

		   -These glosses are consistent with the discussion of inalienable
		   possession suffixation, which also says that -o means 1sg.poss,
		   though that doesn't seem to be in our choices file. Also, it only
		   applies as suffixation when the stem ends in the vowel "a".

		   Our plan is to improve the Adnominal Possession phenomena for
		   inalienable possession markers -o, -m, -n.

      -List of other SEMANTICALLY EMPTY WORD candidates:
      
      	    k' --- one sem. empty aux 27
	    aqani -- " aux_28
	    poro --- noun1_stem369 w/ pred, " aux_22

	    porokiny -- " aux_22
	    keiny --- noun_50 (pron_n_rel), " aux_19
	    
     	    k' seems like an alternation of any irrealis clitic, as the descriptive
	    resources has it glossed for 3sg.fut and 1pl.fut. But it only
	    occurs in the test corpus once, as "fut", though it looks like from the
	    context it should have 1sg agreement.

	    aqani is glossed as "present.with.gifts" or "support". The Titan-English
	    dictionary in our resources has the following entry:

	    	       NB: what does Lusk mean?

	    	       aqani v.tr 1. present with gifts, present, offer
		       2. support, look after
		       Lusk: agani 'feed


            poro is glossed as a hole.
	    porokiny means pot
	    T-E Dictionary entry:

	    	
		poro n.ia hole.
		porokiny n
		1. pot
		2. wooden bowl.
		Lusk: porokin.


	    kine is a 3sg perfective marker, part of the set kune, kone, kine, and kane
	    which correspond to their similar irrealis verb clitic markers.
	    
	    Keiny is glossed as "pot", and is a synonym with porokiny
	    in the English-Titan glossary.


With semantically empty words, we'll add more constraints and might refine trigger rules.

     3.1.2 Final testsuite with final grammar for the week

     	   60/157 items parsed.
     	   53/85 positive items parsed (62.4% coverage)
	   7/73 negative items parsed (9.6% overgeneration) huge improvement :)

     What is the avg # of parses per parsed item?
     	     1.11 for coverage, 1.00 for overgeneration ( also improvements :) )

     How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?

     	  This sentence received 3 distinct analyses:

	  Ala        kip
	  3pl.realis lie
	  "They lied."

	  The ambiguity seems to stem from the fact there are 3 different parses for 'ala'.
	  One as a realis agr clitic verb, one as a noun with _3pl_n_rel, and one as a noun
	  with _pron_n_rel. Same ambiguity occurs in the corpus.

     3.2.1 Test corpus with initial grammar for the week
     
      - 38/563 positive items (6.7% coverage
      - On average, parsed items had 2.89 distinct analyses.

      - Most ambiguous item:
	The most ambiguous items had 10 and 15 parses.

	  The sentence with 15 parses is:

	     ala va  yota    ka   mulie
	     3pl say 1pl.inc hort turn
	     'They said let s turn around'

	  10 parses:

	      i va awa ka la
	      3sg say 2pl hort go
      	     'He said you go.'

	      ato va i kine me
	      3pl say 3sg 3sg.perf come
	      'They said he s come.'

       These sentences are using the complement embedding verb 'va' and the irrealis verb clitic 'ka.' We know there
       are two entries for 'va'. There only seems to be one entry for 'ka', though. My guess is that there's lots
       of structural ambiguity in how the VP trees are constructed.

     3.2.2 Test corpus with final grammar for the week

     	   - 29 out of 562 items (5.2%), so our coverage went slightly down
     	   -On average, parsed items had 1.45 distinct analyses (much less ambiguity,
	       probably because we limited auxiliaries to taking VP complements only.
	       
	   -Most ambiguous item:
	   	 The most ambiguous item had 3 parses (and it showed up in two different places in the corpus)
		 The IGT provided was the following:

		 ala va  yota     ka   mulie
		 3pl say 1pl.incl hort run
		 They said let  s      turn around

		 The three trees seem to correspond to 3 different parses for 'ala'. One has 'ala' as a verb,
		 the 3pl realis agr clitic. The other two correspond to nominal parses for 'ala', and one of
		 them correctly has _pron_n_rel, but another has _3pl_n_rel. I have to say that its pretty
		 annoying at this point to see that last player, but its an easy fix.
