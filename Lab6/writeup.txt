Lab 5 Writeup
By David Krug and Nathaniel Imel

===============================================================================
1. A description of the changes you made to your semi.vpm file, why you made
those specifc changes, and how that affected generator output.
===============================================================================
2. A description of the phenomena you improved in the grammar (including both
the morphology etc clean up and adnominal possession or clausal complements),
including:

NB: we've done both already. What should we work on this week?

Something else
in the MT list of sentences?

How well do adposs and clausal complements work? Can we make them better? I.e.,
lets at least delete the automatically inferred 'va' entry thats transitive.

   - Prose description of the phenomenon
    
   - Prose description of your analysis
    
   - The specific changes you made to the tdl (paste in the actual tdl)
    
   - Specific IGT I can use to test the analysis / investigate if something isn't
    working and you need help.
===============================================================================
3. A description of the performance of your final grammar for this week on the
test suite and test corpus, as compared to your starting grammar (see details above).

     3.2.1 Test corpus with initial grammar for the week
     
      - On average, parsed items had 2.89 parses.

      - Most ambiguous item:
	The most ambiguous items had 10 and 15 parses.

	  The sentence with 15 parses is:

	     ala va  yota    ka   mulie
	     3pl say 1pl.inc hort turn
	     'They said let s turn around'

	  10 parses:

	      i va awa ka la
	      3sg say 2pl hort go
      	     'He said you go.'

	      ato va i kine me
	      3pl say 3sg 3sg.perf come
	      'They said he s come.'

       These sentences are using the complement embedding verb 'va' and the irrealis verb clitic 'ka.' We know there
       are two entries for 'va'. There only seems to be one entry for 'ka', though. My guess is that there's lots
       of structural ambiguity in how the VP trees are constructed.
